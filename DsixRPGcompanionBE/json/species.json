The Aing-Tii head was small and jutted out perpendicularly from their chest. The head featured two large eyes and a series of long, thin tongues that extended around half a meter from their mouths. Each Aing-Tii had a long, prehensile tail that could be used in self-defense. The Aing-Tii each had a set of painted motifs covering their entire bodies, though the patterns were unique to each Aing-Tii. The species did not communicate through speech, as they were incapable of producing sound. Instead, they conveyed information via tasting, smelling, and touching each other with their six long, thin green tongues.",

The average Chagrian stood taller than a Human with blue skin ranging in tone from light blue to indigo. They were distinguished by two fleshy growths protruding from the sides of their heads, which they called lethorns. Males also sported two horns growing from the top of their skulls. These were once used in underwater duels to attract a mate, and were seen as a sign of the males' strength and virility. Females lacked the superior cranial horns, but had more pronounced and longer posterior head plates. These could reach halfway down their back. Chagrians also had very long black forked tongues. Chagrians were truly amphibious, retaining their ability to breathe underwater while also able to function without difficulty in air. They also possessed acute low-light vision.",

This way of life ended when the Rift Disaster occurred, which nearly destroyed the Charr Ontee. Those that survived served the Darkstryder as it watched over the Lifewell. When the time came for the Kathol to awaken, the Darkstryder defied its programming and banished the Charr Ontee for opposing it. This made them the eternal enemies of the Darkstryder construct, living far from the creature's fortress on the Kathol homeworld. This time apart allowed them to develop their own culture and society but they gradually discovered a terrible secret from their origins. They had learned that on a genetic level the species was degenerating, but this did not affect them learning to use the Ta-Ree life energy and they became quite adept in its usage. This made them a force to be reckoned with in the Kathol Rift and the more powerful of the Kathol servants. A group that survived the cataclysm on Kathol were thrown into a pocket of Otherspace and over time degenerated into the Charon species who sought to destroy all life.",

They were physiologically much like other humanoid species, with their twin hearts being a notable exception. According to sources such as The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life, one Chev heart could take over when the other failed, allowing Chevs to live for up to three hundred standard years.",

Since the Chevin were a nomadic people, the Chevs were forced to live nomadically as well. Their temporary settlements of tents and lean-tos were ruled by a Chevin overseer, with the oldest female Chev acting as the leader among the slaves. Giving what political power the Chevs had to the oldest among them was criticized by some younger Chevs, who believed this simply perpetuated the system of slavery.

They had large eyelids and small eyes capable of seeing into the infrared spectrum, which they used to survive in the subterranean darkness.",
    "species_personality": "Coway were a primitive, reclusive species. They spent their lives in caves and had a dislike of outsiders. They were fond of charms and believed in the power of their warrior god Canu.",
    "species_background": "Coway tribes lived in large villages where order was maintained by brute force. Any outsiders who ventured too close would be attacked. Males were dominant in Coway society and each village was ruled by a triumvirate of chiefs who answered only to the will of Canu, a warrior god.\n\nIf the chiefs encountered gridlock when they attempted to resolve an issue by themselves, they submitted the problem to Canu. Because the Coway believed that Canu demanded strength from his followers, the greatest warriors of the conflicting parties would face each other in single combat until one quit or died. The winner of the contest would be presumed to be favored by Canu and therefore the chiefs would rule in favor of the party that the winner fought for. If the loser had lost because he quit, he and the party that he championed would abide by Canu's judgment and pay his respects to him by hitting the winner in the face. The winner was expected to return the favor or else face the prospect of angering Canu—and another physical contest.\n\nThe largest known Coway village contained a population of at least two hundred. It was located in a large subterranean amphitheater near an ancient Thrella city that was adjacent to a subterranean lake. The village itself contained two Thrella structures that the tribe kept in an outward state of repair at the very least.\n\nThe cave drawings of the Coway and the pictographs of the Mimbanites—another intelligent species native to Mimban and genetic cousins of the Coway—were extremely similar to those found in the Temple of Pomojema. This led many New Republic xenoarchaeologists to theorize that the two species and the temple—as well as the ancient civilization that had built it—were connected in some way.\n\nThe Coway commonly made their way to the surface through Coway shafts which connected to Thrella wells as well as sinkholes and other openings. During their early days, they could come and go as they pleased. However, when the Galactic Empire discovered that Mimban was rich in dolovite, it established a mining facility on the planet. Rather than be subjugated by the Empire as their genetic cousins would be, the Coway retreated further into the subterranean depths, believing that they could find some refuge from the Empire's energy drills.\n\nThe Coways' relative peace was short-lived. The Empire's mining operations managed to further disrupt their way of life. The Coway responded by rebelling with occasional acts of unpredictable violence. Sometime after the Imperial presence had been well-established, Coway would only periodically venture into the outskirts of the five mining towns. If they were confronted, they would flee. This behavior led many of the locals and miners to mistakenly believe that the Coway were shy and peaceful.",

     "species_physical_description": "Devaronians were one of the more unusual races in the galaxy, with a dramatic gender dimorphism in appearance and temperament. The males were aggressive by nature, many being described as brash or bull-headed, with typically red-tinted skin and a pair of large horns growing from their heads. They took great pride in their horns, and groomed them quite regularly. Many species felt uncomfortable in their presence, for they resembled the devils of a thousand different myths. Female Devaronians were covered in thick fur that ranged in color from brown to white, hornless and had prominent canine teeth. They were docile, non-aggressive creatures. They tended to be dominant in their culture, being the only ones allowed to participate in government and politics. Several female Devaronians not covered with thick fur revealed two dark circles above the forehead, where the horns usually are in males. In addition, the teeth of the males were all sharp incisors, but the females also had molars and prominent canines. One in fifty Devaronian males had two sets of teeth, however, having an inner set of sharp \"male\" teeth and an outer, retractable set of \"female\" teeth. In primitive times, such males were used as solitary scouts by Devaronian tribes, since they could survive on either meat or plants. Males also had an extremely long tongue, though whether females shared this trait is unknown. The teeth were useful for some languages. A Devaronian had to continually and repeatedly retract and extend both sets of teeth to speak Huttese. Their bodies were denser than most humanoids' and as a result, they were heavier than their appearance would tend to indicate. Perhaps as a result, they had multiple livers. Their blood was silver based.",
    "species_personality": "Devaronian males were driven by an urge to wander, usually taking the first opportunity to move on from one place to another. As such, they were often found traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts. Female Devaronians, on the other hand, were content to remain in a single location, and, as such, raised the young and ran the government of Devaron. The males sent as much money as they could manage back to their homeworld to support their families, but otherwise hardly ever returned once they had begun to travel the stars. The females were content with this arrangement, as they tended to view the restless males as disruptive to home life. Mating rituals consisted of the season of Koh'hibril. Females were dominant therefore, as that was the only time couples spent long periods together.",
    "species_background": "First devising the tumble hyperdrive around 27,000 BBY, Devaronians were one of the first species in the galaxy to develop interstellar travel. The males of the species had been common sights in spaceports throughout the galaxy for thousands of years by the time of the Galactic Civil War. Sometime during the rise of the Empire, one Kardue'sai'Malloc, a captain in the Devaronian Army, received the order to put down a rebellion against the Empire on Devaron. The rebels were taking refuge in the ancient city of Montellian Serat. He shelled the city until the rebels surrendered, then finished it, turning the city to rubble. When he received more orders to move south to another group of rebels, interpreting them as ordering mass executions, he herded the seven hundred rebels into a holding pen, then had the guards open fire. Very few Devaronians joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. One Devaronian, Vilmarh Grahrk, was an infamous con artist and smuggler active during the latter days of the Galactic Republic. Another infamous Devaronian, going under the name of Labria, was seen in the Mos Eisley Cantina when Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker came in looking for passage offworld. At the time, one of the galaxy's highest bounties had been placed on his head for his deadly criminal activities. A third, Kapp Dendo, served with the Alliance to Restore the Republic and eventually became a general in the New Republic military.",

Their finned tails and webbed hands were used in swimming, while their claws and sharp teeth were testament to their carnivorous nature. They had both lungs and gills, and were at home in fresh or salt water down to two kilometers deep. Though they could also survive on land, they needed to keep their skins moist. They were also cold-blooded, and could not tolerate temperature extremes. On land, they stood 1.3 to 1.7 meters tall, and walked with a slightly hunched gait, using their tails for balance. Draedans made their homes in coral reefs, underwater lataren forests, or in moist forests on land.",

    "species_physical_description": "The Duros were humanoids with smooth blue-green skin, red eyes, lipless mouths, long thin noseless faces and green blood. Olfactory organs beneath their eyes were responsible for their sense of smell. Both females and males were bald, though both genders were easily distinguished. Their large red goggle-like eyes also had slit pupils. Duros females laid eggs as they are descended from ancient reptiles, and like the Neimoidians they were born in a larval grub stage, but unlike their cousins who left the raising of their young mainly to the state, the Duros took care of their offspring from birth.",
    "species_personality": "While usually taciturn, Duros enjoyed telling stories about their travels. It was said Duros had a photographic memory when it came to the telling of tales and stories. Many Duros were pilots and explorers, and were adventurous, though sometimes rash. As one of the first cultures to develop hyperdrive spacecraft (some even believe the first), Duros-charted trade routes were among the oldest hyperspace routes still in use during the Imperial era. Even in the later periods of galactic history, Duros were still known for their superior astro-navigational skills. Their affinity for traveling led many Duros to prefer the honorific title of 'Traveler' despite their occupation or craft of choice, and addressing them as such was considered good etiquette.",
    "species_background": "The Duros originated on the planet Duro long before the dawn of the Galactic Republic. In 100,000 BBY, Duro was surveyed by the Columi, who were not impressed. Later, Duro was conquered by the Rakata of the Infinite Empire and the native Duros were enslaved. Duros slaves were used to create the Star Forge in 30,000 BBY. However, they tolerated their cruel overlords since it was an occasion for the ever-curious Duros to learn about their inter-stellar technology. Following a plague in 25,200 BBY that killed only Rakata, the Duros rebelled and overthrew their Rakatan masters. The Duros then formed a hereditary monarchy. After the fall of the Empire, they quickly reverse-engineered the engines left by the Rakata, and thus invented the hyperspace cannon independently of the Corellians. At an early age, the Duros became interested in exploration and ventured off their homeworld to explore the galaxy and their interstellar technology linked Duro with Coruscant, Corellia, and other Core Worlds; with the Corellians they built the first arm of the Corellian Trade Spine and with the invention of the hyperdrive, the planet entered a Golden Age as a Core Founder in 25,053 BBY under Queen Rana Mas Trehalt. The Duros also constructed large shipyards and spacedocks in their planet's orbit. The monarchy was eventually abolished in favor of a collection of ruling corporations.",

    "species_physical_description": "The Elomin were horned humanoids from Elom who lived on the surface of the planet while another sentient species—the Elom—lived underground. Elomin skin featured a variety of colors from bright pink to dark purple. Features of their anatomy which distinguished them from baseline humans included neck wattles, spanchons, four stomachs, generative nodes, six-chambered hearts, nose tusks, long hairs which grew behind their ears, and horns.",
    "species_personality": "Elomin strove to find order in things and worked to create order where none existed. Therefore, they were unable to cope with the unstructured attack of a perfectly executed Marg Sabl maneuver. The Elomin were obsessed with personal hygiene, combing their long ear hair and polishing their horns.",
    "species_background": "The Elomin were thought by some xenoarchaeologists to be descended from a lost colony of Zabrak who settled Elom in the distant past. The Elomin inhabited the surface of their planet, initially unaware that another intelligent species inhabited the crust below. The Elom had once lived on the surface, but were forced to move underground when water became scarce. They remained isolated, continuing to retreat further underground. When the Elomin re-discovered the Eloms, their government tried to convince the Galactic Republic that they were only unintelligent animals, and pressed them in to service as servants and laborers. The truth was eventually discovered, and Eloms were granted the same rights as other sentient species. Despite their newly bestowed suffrage, Eloms did not seem to be interested in politics, and continued to live in their burrows. The Elomin continued to govern the world of Elom and represented the planet offworld. When the Galactic Empire came to power, they enslaved the Elomin to work in their own lommite mines. The Eloms staged raids and rescued numerous Elomin from slavery. After their planet was liberated by the Republic, the two species began integrating their societies together.",

Members of the species ranged in height from 0.75 to 1.5 meters, although aged members of the species sometimes appeared shorter due to a stooped posture. Their five-fingered hands sported sharp claws. Thick hair covered the body except for most of the face and fingers. The Geelan visage was wrinkled and hairless except for a hairy beard along the chin. Two resplendent, yellow eyes peered forward from atop a snout full of sharp teeth that protruded even when the mouth was closed. In some specimens, the muzzle was short and snubbed, but in most members of the species, it was long and prominent. A dark, wet nose lay at the end of the snout. Pointed ears stood erect on the sides of the head, large in some Geelan but small in others. Few taller beings found the Geelan's appearance intimidating.",
    "species_personality": "The Geelan personality was driven by two overwhelming goals: to obtain an ever-increasing store of possessions, and to do so by getting the best of others in negotiations. They were known for being intrusive, annoying, covetous, and greedy for personal profit. They were born hagglers with a well-earned reputation as experts at negotiation. Geelan were also known for being resourceful entrepreneurs, thriving in business environments where their bargaining skills were the key to success. Their love for acquiring possessions meant that their treasure troves, sometimes worth entire starships, were hoarded for future use. Geelan considered any day without some new acquisition to be a day wasted.",
    "species_background": "The Geelan hailed from the planet Needan, which was once a lush, tropical world but cooled into an arctic wasteland after a comet struck the planet. The Geelan were forced to inhabit domed cities to survive. As the galaxy grew, many Geelan left their homeworld and became traders, entrepreneurs, and negotiators, operating from the space station Zirtran's Anchor. Zirtran's Anchor became a hub for Geelan activity, where their haggling skills and hoarding tendencies shaped their unique approach to business. Despite a rough and tumble negotiation style, Geelan thrived in commerce, taking pride in every successful deal.",

The enterprising smugglers soon began making a profit selling the Gigorans to interested parties, including the Empire, for heavy labor.

Gotals’ eyes can be red, orange, yellow, gray, green, or black. Their skin ranges from gray-brown to black, and their fur varies between white, brown, and gray. Males typically have a thick fringe of facial hair, while females lack this feature. Gotals shed fur naturally but can lose control under stress. Their natural odor resembles mildew and sweat. They are resistant to Killik venom.",

This ability shapes their culture, allowing them to excel in professions such as bounty hunting, diplomacy, and Jedi service. They have a reputation for being cautious and observant, yet their strong reliance on their cones makes them wary of droids, which emit electromagnetic interference that can be overwhelming. Gotals find beauty in horn size, often enhancing smaller cones artificially. They prefer relationships with other horned species and can become deeply attached to their mates. Their perception of emotions can make them either highly intuitive or socially distant, depending on their individual disposition.",

However, conflicts such as the Duinuogwuin-Gotal War and the Separatist Crisis led them to side with the wrong factions, causing hardships during the Clone Wars. Their distrust of the Galactic Empire kept them on the fringes until they reintegrated into mainstream society under the New Republic and later the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. Their electromagnetic senses made them exceptional hunters, able to detect prey from up to ten kilometers away, relying solely on their cones.

Their ancient civilization achieved remarkable technological advancements, including gravity-manipulating machines, though this early empire collapsed millennia before contact with the wider galaxy. During the Galactic Republic era, their distinctive angular freighters became common sights. Under Imperial rule, after initial resistance, they pragmatically submitted to maintain their infrastructure. Herglic communities spread throughout the galaxy, particularly along trade routes and in the Tapani sector, where they integrated into local societies while maintaining their cultural identity. Notable Herglic populations existed on Lamuir IV, Tallaan, Abregado-rae, and Esseles, often forming distinct 'Herglictown' neighborhoods due to their size requirements.",

    "species_physical_description": "H'nemthe are bipedal reptilian humanoids with distinctive physical features including four sensory cone horns on their heads, ridged bony faces, and long, gently curving noses. They have three-fingered hands and skin that ranges from pink to blue-gray in color. Their average height matches that of humans at 1.7 meters tall. The four sensory cones on their heads function similarly to Gotal horns, allowing them to detect electromagnetic fields, weather patterns, heat differences, and even the emotional states of other beings. These adaptations evolved to cope with their homeworld's extreme and irregular weather patterns caused by its three moons. Females possess a razor-sharp, knife-shaped tongue used in their unique mating rituals.",
    "species_personality": "H'nemthe are a peaceful species with a deep appreciation for the arts, particularly music, poetry, and calligraphy. Their culture revolves around the concept of true love and spiritual fulfillment through mating, despite its fatal consequences for males. They are generally reserved and tend to stay close to their homeworld, with females living particularly sheltered lives. Male H'nemthe spend much of their lives searching for true love, while virgin females are rare and highly protected. The species has a philosophical outlook on life and death, viewing the male's sacrificial death during mating as a spiritual transition rather than an end. Their spoken language is considered unpleasant by outsiders, but their musical compositions are widely appreciated.",
    "species_background": "H'nemthe society is shaped by an extreme gender imbalance, with only one female born for every twenty males. This has led to a culture centered on elaborate mating rituals where females kill their mates after consummation, considered the ultimate proof of love. Their government is a direct democracy typically led by females, as males have shorter lifespans due to mating rituals. The planet H'nemthe has few exports besides minerals, and most H'nemthe rarely leave their homeworld. During the Galactic Empire's rule, many joined the Rebel Alliance on Anoat. Their most notable offworld incident involved virgin female M'iiyoom Onith, who mated with a Gotal in Chalmun's Cantina, resulting in his death. Some H'nemthe worked as bodyguards for Jabba the Hutt or suppliers for the Rebel Alliance. The species was documented by Shi'ido anthropologist Mammon Hoole in The Essential Guide to Alien Species during the New Republic era.",

They are typically calm and graceful, with many developing expertise in healing arts and botanical sciences. Off-world Ho'Din often become botanists, though some leverage their natural grace to become performers.

After developing herbal therapies to combat resulting parasites, they returned to the trees and focused on ecological research. Their subsequent mastery of botanical sciences made Moltok wealthy through plant and medicine exports. The Dinante Fli'R priests rule their society, maintaining strict technology controls while funding ecosystem restoration projects across the galaxy. Notable Ho'Din include the healer Baji, smuggler Par'tah, and Jedi survivors Iwo Kulka and Plett. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, their plant-reverent culture spared them from attacks.",

Their physical bulk rivals that of Wookiees, giving them tremendous raw power. Their muscular frames are supported by dense bone structures capable of withstanding great stress. Despite their size, Houk are surprisingly agile for their bulk, capable of both powerful charges and stealthy movement when the situation calls for it. Their skin is thick and durable, often showing scars from their violent lifestyles, with coloration ranging from pale gray to deep blue-gray.",
    "species_personality": "Houk are known for their short tempers and tendency toward violent solutions to problems. While not as explosively temperamental as Wookiees, they frequently resort to physical confrontation in political and personal matters. Despite this belligerence, Houk display surprising tactical cunning, preferring stealth over direct confrontation in personal combat - a trait that has earned them a reputation for deceit among other species. Individual personalities vary, with some Houk working hard to overcome their species' violent reputation. They tend to be pragmatic in negotiations, often ignoring treaties or acting in bad faith when it serves their interests. Many Houk take particular pleasure in using neuronic whips and similar weapons.",
    "species_background": "The Houk originated on Lijuter in the Reibrin system, eventually establishing thirty-one colonies throughout the Ansuroer sector after contact with Vaathkree traders. Their expansion led to conflicts like the decade-long civil war with Weequay settlers on Sriluur. Governed by the Lijuter Congress, Houk society is marked by corruption and violence, though individual colonies developed distinct cultures. The Galactic Empire targeted Houk for slave experimentation, kidnapping many who were never seen again. Notable Houk include gladiator Anchor Blue, cantina owner Gorb Drig, and criminals Lun Rask and Egome Fass. The species produces little original technology but readily adopts galactic standards, particularly weapons and starships. Their reputation for strength made them prized as gladiators and enforcers.",

Humans exhibit significant physical diversity, with variations in skin tone ranging from pale yellowish brown to dark brown, hair color spanning blond, brown, red, and black (turning gray or white with age), and eye colors including blue, green, gray, and brown. Body hair is relatively light compared to other mammalian species, concentrated mainly on the head and (for adult males) face. Their facial structure, hair texture (straight, wavy, or curly), and body proportions show considerable variation across populations.",
    "species_personality": "Humans display the full spectrum of personality traits and psychological characteristics found among sentient species. They are known for their adaptability, ambition, and diversity of thought. Human societies have produced both great philosophers and ruthless conquerors, brilliant scientists and destructive warmongers. Their emotional range is particularly broad, capable of deep compassion and shocking cruelty. Many Humans exhibit strong exploratory and expansionist tendencies, which has contributed to their galactic dominance. They form complex social structures and cultural systems, with values varying dramatically between different Human civilizations. While some Human groups embrace xenophobia and speciesism, others champion equality and interspecies cooperation.",
    "species_background": "Humans are the galaxy's most numerous and politically dominant sentient species, believed to have originated on Coruscant though their exact homeworld remains uncertain. They spread throughout the Core Worlds even before hyperdrive technology, using sleeper ships for interstellar colonization. Humans played a pivotal role in forming the Galactic Republic and have dominated galactic politics for millennia. Their history includes periods of enlightenment and oppression, from the democratic Republic to the Human-supremacist Galactic Empire. Humans have produced many notable Jedi and Sith, and their species has been at the center of most major galactic conflicts. They can be found in virtually every profession and walk of life across the galaxy, from spacers and mercenaries to farmers and crime lords. While baseline Humans remain the standard, numerous Near-Human subspecies have developed through isolated evolution, including Chiss, Miraluka, and Zeltrons. Human civilization has weathered countless wars and regime changes, continually reasserting its central role in galactic affairs through both constructive and destructive means.",

Their scaled skin provides natural protection, with coloration varying between individuals but typically in earthy tones suited to their native environment. Huraloks have elongated faces with pronounced snouts and sharp teeth, giving them a distinctly predatory appearance. Their eyes are typically yellow or amber with vertical slit pupils, adapted for low-light vision. Their limbs are lean but muscular, built more for quick strikes than brute strength.",
    "species_personality": "Huraloks are notoriously vicious, deceitful, and manipulative, with few redeeming qualities. They hold long-standing grudges against both other species and their own kind, rarely cooperating except when facing existential threats to their species. Most Huraloks prefer to operate through minions rather than direct confrontation, though they will occasionally venture out as soldiers or scoundrels. Their general demeanor is characterized by hatred, greed, and selfishness, making them untrustworthy allies. Even Force-sensitive Huraloks lack the dedication and selflessness required to join the Jedi Order, typically falling to the dark side if they develop Force abilities.",
    "species_background": "Native to Djurmo, Huraloks are an extremely long-lived species with lifespans reaching into the mid-300s. Their society is fractured due to their mutual hatred, with individuals only coming together during times of species-wide crisis - including their rare mating periods. Huraloks gained notoriety as pirates, with Imperial Navy holodramas depicting battles against Huralok pirates becoming popular entertainment. Notable individuals include Ergihel Threk, Fehkla Gorr, Krad Dokahr, and Liirk Ranghul. Their vicious nature and longevity have made them feared throughout the Outer Rim, where they typically operate as crime lords, pirates, or mercenaries when they leave their homeworld.",

Their slug-like bodies consist of a large head with wide, cavernous mouths and huge eyes, supported by stubby arms and a thick muscular tail. Their thick, slimy hides vary in color (green, orange, blue) and conceal powerful musculature beneath layers of fat. Hutts possess natural resistances including: immunity to Force mind tricks, poison/chemical resistance, blaster resistance due to their thick hides, and the ability to regenerate body parts. They can see ultraviolet light, seal their nostrils to hold their breath for hours, and their jaws can distend to swallow large objects. Though appearing sluggish, they can move surprisingly fast when needed.",
    "species_personality": "Hutts are notorious for their greed, ruthlessness, and massive egos. They view themselves as superior beings and master manipulators, using others as pawns in their schemes. Extremely patient and long-lived, they hold grudges for centuries. Most are crime lords who despise physical labor, preferring to command from fortified palaces. They're highly self-centered but value clan members when useful. In Hutt society, greater size equals higher status, leading to deliberate weight gain. Their reputation for criminal activity is so pervasive that most assume all Hutts are involved in illicit operations.",
    "species_background": "Originally from Varl (now lost), Hutts relocated to Nal Hutta where they built a powerful criminal empire in Hutt Space. Their society is clan-based (e.g., Desilijic, Besadii) with complex naming conventions. As hermaphrodites, they reproduce slowly - Huttlets develop in brood pouches for 50 years. They can live nearly 1,000 years, considering 45 years a trivial span. Notable Hutts include Jabba, Durga, and Borvo. The species controls vast criminal networks across the Outer Rim, dealing in spice smuggling, slavery, and other illegal activities. Their longevity and patience make them formidable strategists in the galactic underworld.",

    "species_physical_description": "Iktotchi are humanoid beings averaging 1.8 meters in height with broad, muscular frames. Their most distinctive features are the downward-curving cranial horns present in both genders (though larger in males), which give them an intimidating appearance. These horns can regenerate if damaged. They have tough, wind-resistant skin adapted to their harsh homeworld, and broad hands with fatty digits about 1.5 times the size of human hands. Their facial features are stern and stoic, with deep-set eyes that reflect their contemplative nature. Their robust physiques reflect their origins as mountain-dwelling beings on their windy home moon.",
    "species_personality": "Despite their imposing appearance, Iktotchi are sensitive beings who mask their emotions behind stoic exteriors. They are deeply respectful of other cultures but often struggle with social interactions due to their precognitive abilities unnerving others. Most maintain a reserved demeanor, though they possess strong convictions. Their precognitive gifts make them contemplative by nature, often appearing distant as they process visions of possible futures. They tend to be honest and straightforward, valuing truth over social niceties, which can sometimes make them seem blunt or tactless to other species.",
    "species_background": "The Iktotchi originate from the harsh, windy moon Iktotch in the Expansion Region. They first contacted the Old Republic around 3,500 BBY by carving the Republic symbol into their landscape in anticipation of the visitors. Known for their limited precognitive abilities (strongest on their homeworld) and telepathic skills, they produced notable Jedi like Saesee Tiin and Sith like Darth Cognus. During the Clone Wars, they foresaw the rise of the Empire and retreated to orbital colonies. While largely isolationist under Imperial rule, some joined the Rebel Alliance. They helped establish the New Republic but surprisingly failed to predict the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. Their society values piloting and mechanical skills, with many becoming renowned starfighter pilots or engineers.",

In 2 BBY, G'rho was raided by the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium. Despite Brco's orders to attack with the Conjo fighters, the Ssi-ruuk conquered G'rho and enteched virtually all the colonists, absorbing their life energy into battery coils.

They believe a strong military tradition is essential for maintaining a stable culture. From a young age, they are indoctrinated into military service, with nearly half the population serving in the Iotran Police Force (IPF) at any given time. While not generally respectful toward other cultures, they deeply respect stability and might, which often leads them to support authoritarian regimes like the Galactic Empire. Their personality is characterized by strict adherence to hierarchy, unquestioning obedience to superiors, and a willingness to use force to achieve objectives. They have little regard for jurisdictional boundaries when pursuing their goals.",
    "species_background": "The Iotrans hail from the planet Iotra in the Outer Rim Territories. Their military history spans centuries, having originated several famous military orders including the Kinlandrin Royal Forces, the Lurathi Guard, and the Jengardin Millennial Warriors. Approximately 700 years before the Galactic Civil War, their planet was unified and various military forces merged into the Iotran Police Force (IPF), which serves as both military and law enforcement. The IPF is governed by the Joint Council of eight top-ranking leaders. Iotran technology was primitive by galactic standards, relying on slugthrowers and basic vehicles, though they adopted more advanced technology for defense purposes. At age 14 (18 standard years), all Iotrans begin six years of mandatory IPF service. The species is known for producing Iotran Bracemen - elite enforcers who pursue fugitives across the galaxy, often causing diplomatic incidents. During the Galactic Civil War, most Iotrans supported the Empire, though some favored the Rebel Alliance due to the Republic's historical stability.",

Their lungs function as internal gills when submerged, and they possess an acute sense of smell that works equally well in water or air. Their bodies are adapted for both aquatic and terrestrial movement, with a movement range of 9-11. Their most distinctive feature is their powerful beak, capable of delivering vicious attacks.",
    "species_personality": "Ishi Tib are renowned for their meticulous organizational skills and strategic thinking. They possess a strong communal spirit, having evolved from schooling fish ancestors. While generally peaceful and environmentally conscious, they can become ferocious in combat, using their beaks to devastating effect. They have a primal undercurrent to their otherwise analytical personalities. Offworld Ishi Tib often excel as executives, accountants, and project managers due to their natural planning abilities. They enjoy loud, chaotic music featuring sirens, clanging sounds, and flashing lights - a preference that contrasts with their otherwise methodical nature.",
    "species_background": "The Ishi Tib evolved from fish that escaped predators by leaping onto Tibrin's coral reefs. Their society developed around these reefs, building underwater farms and surface cities. They live in communal 'schools' of up to 10,000 individuals, governed by elected representatives serving one-year terms. Their culture emphasizes ecological preservation above all else. Reproduction is communal, with fertilized eggs raised in reef hatcheries - no Ishi Tib knows their biological parents or children. During the Clone Wars, their loyalties were divided between the Republic and Separatists. Many Ishi Tib work offworld as skilled managers and executives, though some like the criminal Haka Hai have pursued less reputable paths. Their language is Tibranese, and they maintain strong environmental principles even when working in corporate settings.",

They have distinctive physical features including deep-set black eyes, high cheekbones, protruding foreheads, and sharp triangular white teeth. Their most notable characteristic is their unique physiology that allows integration of cybernetic implants without rejection. These implants range from neural enhancements to built-in weapons, with some members replacing entire limbs. The implants are typically covered by skin but can be exposed to appear more intimidating, surrounded by prominent scars. Their movement speed ranges from 8-10. Their bodies produce a special mutagen that facilitates adaptation to foreign matter, contributing to their distinctive appearance and cybernetic compatibility.",
    "species_personality": "Iskalloni appear emotionally detached and calm, often seeming distracted as if their thoughts are elsewhere. They view other species, particularly Humans, as inferior and have no qualms about enslaving them for labor. Their society is highly structured around cybernetic enhancement, with heavily modified leaders making decisions that are followed without question. They struggle to understand why other species resist cybernetic augmentation. While not inherently violent, they readily resort to force to achieve their goals, particularly in acquiring slaves to handle their toxic technology byproducts. They maintain an air of superiority and show little empathy toward other lifeforms.",
    "species_background": "Native to the Wild Space planet Iskadrell, the Iskalloni developed a unique fusion of biotechnology and mechanical devices. Their technology produces deadly toxic waste, leading them to conduct slaving raids to force other species to handle these dangerous materials. They have remained largely isolated from galactic society. Their first contact with the Galactic Empire ended in conflict when they enslaved Imperial agents, prompting a retaliatory attack that devastated half their planet before they repelled the invaders. During the New Republic era, they attempted to capture a New Republic starship through deception. Their society is ruled by heavily modified individuals who function as living computers. The Iskalloni have made few technological advances in centuries and study captured starships hoping to learn safer technology. Notable members include the cyborg leader Locutus of Borg who commands their mothership.",

Their vision out of water is poor, adapted primarily for their underwater environment. They move at speeds of 10-12 on land and 14-16 in water. As water-breathers, they cannot survive out of water for more than an hour without special rebreather equipment. Their bodies are well-adapted for aquatic life, with powerful muscles for swimming and sensory organs optimized for underwater perception.",
    "species_personality": "Chuhkyvi are spiritual and principled beings, known for their strong moral compass and willingness to defend just causes. Unlike other Iskalonian species, they possess a natural curiosity and desire to explore beyond their homeworld. They value community and cooperation, having been part of the Iskalonian School for millennia. While generally peaceful, they will fiercely protect their beliefs and people when threatened. Their experiences as relocated refugees have given them empathy for others facing displacement or hardship. Notable individuals like Kiro demonstrate their capacity for heroism and dedication to greater galactic causes.",
    "species_background": "Originally native to Aquaris, the Chuhkyvi were relocated to Iskalon around 5,000 BBY after a natural disaster devastated their homeworld. They became one of seventeen aquatic species forming the Iskalonian School, maintaining their own language while adopting the common Iskalonian tongue. In 529 BBY, many impoverished Iskalonians were nearly tricked into slavery by Hugo Bartyn's recruiters. The Chuhkyvi-built underwater city of Pavillion was destroyed in 4 ABY by an Imperial attack. While most Iskalonians withdrew from galactic affairs after this, some Chuhkyvi like Kiro continued interacting with the wider galaxy, even joining the early Alliance of Free Planets and studying Jedi teachings. The species briefly faced a Nagai invasion but maintained their isolationist tendencies despite these conflicts.",

Their most unique feature is their twin mouths and four throats, which allow them to speak in stereo. Their reflexes and coordination are slightly slower than average humanoids. They move at speeds of 10-12. Ithorians possess the ability to violently expel air through their four throats, creating a deafening, concussive scream that can be enhanced to destructive levels by Force-sensitive individuals, though most Ithorians never use this ability.",
    "species_personality": "Ithorians are peaceful, polite, and deeply spiritual beings devoted to environmentalism and pacifism. They worship the 'Mother Jungle' and maintain profound respect for all living things. Extremely conversational and respectful of others' views, they avoid conflict and consider it rude to discuss grievances behind someone's back. While generally friendly, some find them dull. Most are vegetarian and refuse to touch anything obtained through violence. They have a communal, cooperative nature but will banish violent individuals. Many Ithorians are curious explorers and traders, traveling the galaxy in herdships. Though pacifists, a few have joined causes like the Rebel Alliance, and rare violent outcasts become bounty hunters or mercenaries.",
    "species_background": "Native to the lush jungle world Ithor, the Ithorians developed a culture that reveres their ecosystem. After discovering repulsorlift technology, they built massive floating 'herdships' to live above their planet, keeping Ithor's surface pristine. These herdships eventually became spaceworthy, allowing interstellar travel. Ithorians gather every five years for 'the Meet,' a grand festival of herd ships. They made first contact with the Republic in 12,000 BBY and became known for ecological restoration, helping planets devastated by wars. Their society is led by nature priests and Merchantates. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Ithor was destroyed, forcing the Ithorians to resettle on worlds like Borao, Oetrago, and Felucia. Their language is beautiful but complex, spoken through their twin mouths, though they can speak Basic with a unique accent.",

    "species_physical_description": "The Iyra are sentient cephalopods with round bodies featuring multiple tentacles radiating from a plump central section with a gaping maw underneath. Their rubbery skin can change color for camouflage or communication, displaying complex patterns. Each tentacle has two rows of suction cups and is paired with an eyestalk on top of the body. Iyra range from 1-2 meters in diameter. They lack an internal skeleton but have a flexible brainpan protecting their large brain. Their skin serves as a respiratory organ in both air and water, provided it stays moist. Iyra are born with four tentacles and grow more throughout their lives, with each new tentacle paired with an eyestalk. They can withstand extreme water pressure and are excellent swimmers but move clumsily on land.",
    "species_personality": "Iyra are often perceived as arrogant and haughty by other species, with large egos matching their intelligence. They have a rigid caste system based on tentacle count, with higher-caste Iyra looking down on those with fewer limbs (including most humanoids). Status-conscious and prone to duels to settle disputes, Iyra believe social mobility comes naturally through tentacle growth. They value wisdom that comes with age but some younger Iyra resent their elders. Though generally preferring Iyra company, they can form friendships across species, as seen with academic Tem Eliss. Iyra merchants are common in galactic trade, though they prefer water worlds or low-gravity environments.",
    "species_background": "The Iyra evolved on the aquatic world F'tral (meaning 'water' in their language), where 93% of the surface is submerged. They developed advanced underwater cities using geothermal energy to create corrosion-resistant alloys. Their society is governed by a strict tentacle-based caste system, with disputes often settled through limb-loss duels. Iyra technology focuses on hydraulics, magnetism, and fusion, with innovative starships using water vapor instead of liquid to reduce mass. Their homeworld was part of Hutt Space during the Clone Wars era. Notable Iyra include sentientologist Tem Eliss, who authored The University of Sanbra Guide to Intelligent Life while opposing Imperial policies. Iyra can be found throughout the galaxy, particularly on water worlds like Krinemonen III where they work alongside other aquatic species in shipbuilding.",

They have a strong tradition of oral storytelling. Historically violent, their society socializes young Jarells to accept periods of indentured servitude as a rite of passage. They approach this service with excitement, viewing it as an opportunity to gain power or wealth. While generally loyal to employers, they will act against them if beneficial. Jarells speak Jarellian, a language with multiple dialects but no written form.",
    "species_background": "Native to Oon Tien in the Kathol sector, Jarells developed a primitive matriarchal society organized into city-states. About 300 years before the Galactic Civil War, Republic colony ships made contact and began trading weapons and technology for gemstones and indentured service from Jarell youth. This led to armed conflicts that reshaped their society. While technologically primitive, they became integrated into the Kathol sector's economy, with many migrating to worlds like Kolatill, Pembric II, and Corjain. Their homeworld became important for manufacturing and agriculture. Jarells are commonly found serving as hired muscle for corporations, private citizens, and criminal organizations throughout the sector.",

Their gaunt, rodent-like features include shrunken faces and sensitive vision adapted for low-light conditions. Jawas maintain an extremely high body temperature of 46°C (116°F) and possess a strong natural odor that conveys complex information about identity, health, and emotional state among their kind. Their efficient digestive systems extract all necessary nutrients from their staple diet of hubba gourd.",
    "species_personality": "Jawas are compulsive scavengers with an instinctive feel for machinery and electronics. They view all technology through the lens of potential trade value, following the motto: 'Don't look for uses in an item, but rather imagine someone else who might find a use for it.' While often perceived as swindlers by outsiders (a reputation many Jawas take pride in), they are fundamentally passive beings who prefer trade to conflict. They communicate in Jawaese, a rapid-fire language supplemented by scent cues, though they use a simplified Jawa Trade Language when dealing with other species. Jawas are intensely communal, with strong clan loyalties and a scavenger's eye for opportunity.",
    "species_background": "Jawas are native to Tatooine, possibly descended from the ancient Kumumgah species alongside the Tusken Raiders. Their civilization transformed when they adopted abandoned Czerka Corporation sandcrawlers around 3,959 BBY, using these massive vehicles as mobile fortresses for desert scavenging operations. Jawa society is organized into matriarchal clans, each led by a male Clan-Chief but spiritually guided by a female Shaman (often Force-sensitive). They live in desert fortresses made from salvaged starship parts and conduct annual gatherings in the Dune Sea for trade and marriage arrangements. While primarily found on Tatooine, Jawa clans have migrated to other desert and garbage worlds like Ryloth, Florrum, and Raxus Prime. Their technical skills made them valuable even to the Empire, with some forcibly recruited to repair equipment on Skip 5.",

    "species_physical_description": "Jiivahar are hairless simian humanoids standing 1.55-1.85 meters tall with a narrow, streamlined body structure. They possess hollow, bird-like bones that make them lightweight but fragile. Their long, flexible limbs end in four thin digits capable of wrapping completely around tree branches. Their flat, elongated cranium features two large cones at the back and arched grooves along the sides. Large, lidded pupil-less eyes are widely spaced on their faces. Skin pigmentation varies from light green to dark brown, covered in tiny pockmarks that aid climbing. Jiivahar secrete sarvin, a strong adhesive substance, from pores in their hands and feet that provides exceptional grip on most surfaces. This secretion can be removed through controlled perspiration within one round.",
    "species_personality": "Jiivahar are naturally curious and peaceable, having evolved in a predator-free environment that fostered trust and community. They actively seek new experiences but often lack caution when encountering other species. Their society values communal living through talins (groups of 5-10 families) with annual Kinn-taas festivals redistributing goods according to need. Leadership is based on wisdom rather than hierarchy, and decisions are made through persuasion rather than force. Their inherent curiosity has led some Jiivahar to leave their homeworld, though their trusting nature sometimes makes them vulnerable to exploitation.",
    "species_background": "The Jiivahar evolved in the giant thykar conifer forests of Carest One in the Inner Rim. With no natural predators, they developed a peaceful, egalitarian society organized around semi-nomadic talins that return to permanent settlements during cold seasons. Contact with tourists visiting Carest One's lush forests introduced advanced technology that disrupted their traditional Kinn-taas redistribution system. Some Jiivahar became guides for offworld visitors, while others like Jannpyr achieved fame in this role. Their curiosity has led many Jiivahar to explore the galaxy, with some joining the Rebel Alliance as pathfinders or, in the case of outcasts like Klevb, becoming mercenaries. The species has faced challenges adapting their communal values to galactic society, particularly when dealing with advanced technology and weapons.",

Notable Jillsarians include Doodnik Sharpelz, who owned Doodnik's Café on Tyne's Horky after spending formative years on Ojom.

Highly religious, they follow the Jydan faith with its multiple gods and prophets, though various sects like Ni'Shaw-Dak have emerged. Their isolationist tendencies stem from discomfort with 'treacherous' species they encountered. Ka'hren approach agreements with absolute seriousness, as their word is considered unbreakable bond. They initially lacked historical records but later established the University of Timb to preserve knowledge after galactic contact.",

Before galactic contact, they maintained oral traditions but lacked written history, causing legendary figures like the Unfyr warriors to fade from memory. Their society revolves around the sacred Jydan Writings and Volumes of Truth, which dictate religious laws and ethics. Contact with outsiders forced them to confront concepts of betrayal and adapt their knowledge preservation methods. Strict isolationist policies require any Ka'hren seeking to leave V'shar to obtain permission from all seven nation leaders. Notable religious developments include Kaltor Naklian's Ni'Shaw-Dak sect around 2 ABY.",

They possess round heads with large compound eyes, four arms, two legs, and prehensile tails. Their exoskeletal structure allows them to survive up to 25 days without water. The species is divided into several races distinguished by size, carapace color, and culture. The most technologically advanced are the mountain-dwelling Kamarians who inhabit cave systems. The 'Badlander' subspecies are smaller (1.1-1.4 meters), more primitive, and adapted to extreme desert conditions, capable of surviving even longer without water and enduring higher temperatures up to 85°C.",
    "species_personality": "Kamarians organize into feudal city-states called tk'skquas that frequently war with each other. They are technologically developing but culturally isolated, with some groups just achieving nuclear technology while others remain primitive. The Badlanders developed a religious cult around the holodocumentary 'Varn, World of Water' after encountering Han Solo's makeshift holotheater. Kamarians can be fiercely devoted to their beliefs and territorial about their clan affiliations. Their segmented society creates strong in-group loyalty but also persistent inter-clan rivalries. Those exposed to galactic culture show intense curiosity mixed with cultural misunderstanding.",
    "species_background": "Native to Kamar, this species developed in relative isolation until encounters with smugglers like Han Solo and Chewbacca introduced them to galactic technology and culture. The Badlanders' accidental exposure to a water-world documentary spawned the Cult of Varn, which later captured Solo believing he could transform their desert world. Kamarians remain largely pre-spaceflight, organized in warring tk'skquas, though some mountain clans approach fusion technology. During the Dark Nest Crisis, some fell under Killik influence through black membrosia. Their society represents a mix of emerging technology and ancient tribal structures, with different groups developing at varying rates across their world.",

Their most distinctive features include long thin necks, digitigrade legs adapted for seabeds, and small bulbous skulls. Males display headcrests and fin ridges, while females are completely bald. Their glassy-eyed appearance and graceful movements reflect their oceanic origins. Kaminoans mature quickly, reaching adulthood by age 11 and maintaining peak physical condition until around 40 years old, with some individuals like Kina Ha living over 1,000 years.",
        "species_personality": "Kaminoans maintain an outwardly polite but inwardly superior attitude, viewing themselves as the pinnacle of genetic perfection. They respect species seeking self-improvement but consider others inferior. Their society is rigidly caste-based, with eye color determining social status: gray for administrators, yellow for skilled workers, and blue for laborers. Green-eyed individuals are considered genetic defects and exterminated. Kaminoans are perfectionists who value scientific achievement above all else, showing little concern for ethical implications of their work. While generally emotionless, they practice the Nahra dance to express rare emotional displays. Their xenophobia stems from long isolation, though they maintain professional relationships with clients.",
        "species_background": "The Kaminoans barely survived their planet's Great Flood by mastering cloning and genetic engineering. This near-extinction event shaped their culture into one focused on genetic perfection and isolationism. They eventually offered cloning services to select clients, most notably creating the Grand Army of the Republic from Jango Fett's template at Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas' request. Their cloning facilities produced both standard troopers and specialized units like ARC troopers, while rejecting imperfect specimens like the Null-class clones. During the Clone Wars, they gained Galactic Senate representation through Senator Halle Burtoni. After Order 66, the Empire seized their facilities, leading to a failed rebellion crushed by the 501st Legion. Post-Empire, they joined the New Republic and contributed against the Yuuzhan Vong threat.",

They possess unusual facial structures with beak-like nasal openings, toothless mouths featuring upper and lower hard palates, and fleshy strands. Extrasensory organs frame their heads, terminating in small black tusks. Their unique physiology requires antiox breath masks and protective goggles in oxygen-rich atmospheres, as Dorin's helium-based atmosphere makes standard galactic environments fatal. Without their goggles, Kel Dors are effectively blind off-world. Their masks also amplify their voices, which would otherwise be nearly inaudible in foreign atmospheres.",

They take pride in their ancient Force tradition, the Baran Do Sages, though this has waned since joining the Republic. Upper classes maintain superstitions about naming children off-world and long names attracting 'wind spirits.'",

The Sages specialized in weather prediction and danger foresight, advising powerful families. After joining the Republic, their influence declined as Jedi recruited Force-sensitive Kel Dors. Notable Kel Dors include Jedi Master Plo Koon and his niece Sha Koon, members of the renowned Koon ('explorer') family. The Baran Do survived Order 66 due to their obscurity. Kel Dor society maintains unique naming traditions - surnames reflect ancestral trades (like 'Koon') while given names mimic atmospheric sounds from Dorin. Their justice system is severe but consistent, and they've contributed several Jedi to the Order while maintaining their own Force traditions.",

Their bodies are built for both arboreal living and flight, with strong limbs and flexible joints that allow for graceful movement through both trees and air.",
    "species_personality": "Kentra are simple, friendly beings with a strong sense of humor and honesty. They place immense value on honor, which serves as the primary social measure in their society. A dishonorable Kentra faces permanent banishment. Despite their generally honest nature, they can be supple with truth when necessary. They have a strong communal spirit, with loyalty to nest, family, and village being paramount. Their warrior culture emphasizes using skills for the benefit of the community rather than individual gain.",
    "species_background": "The Kentra are indigenous to Orellon II, where they lived in villages among the colossal buntra trees, with some larger cities built into mountain ridges. Their society was organized into nests, families, and villages, with regional clans and racial flocks forming larger social structures. Major cities were governed by lords who advised the Kentra king. Their religion, the Holy Order of the Je'ulajists, worshiped the prophet Tandre, who was actually a Jedi Knight that crash-landed on their planet centuries before the Galactic Civil War. Tandre taught them Jedi ways and left behind computer programs to guide them after his death. Kentra speak a variant of Basic called 'bas'c' and maintain a strong warrior tradition with strict honor codes.",

They have two thin strips of hair growing in a double widow's peak from ridges on their head, continuing down their back. Their nose consists of a single vertical slit above their mouth, and their small ears are little more than holes at the base of the skull surrounded by folds of skin. Their physical appearance reflects their carnivorous ancestry and adaptation to harsh conditions.",
    "species_personality": "Kerestians are aggressive, determined hunters shaped by their harsh environment. Having descended into barbarism after their civilization's collapse, they kill without remorse when necessary for survival. Their interactions are marked by constant wariness, as even mating approaches carry the threat of becoming prey. They embrace their mythology of the Great Darkness after death, showing no fear of their perceived eternal fate. Despite their savage nature, they can be highly disciplined when removed from their homeworld's desperate conditions, as shown by those from colony ships who maintained their original civilized culture.",
    "species_background": "The Kerestians once had a sophisticated civilization with fusion technology and sublight space travel on their homeworld Kerest. Their society collapsed when their variable sun entered an inactive cycle, plunging temperatures and covering most of the planet in glaciers. Reduced to barbarism, they hunted each other to near extinction. Discovered by House of Tagge explorers, some Kerestians left their dying world as assassins. They spread through the galaxy as mercenaries, bounty hunters, and Imperial servants, with some joining the Rebel Alliance against Imperial exploitation. Notable individuals include bounty hunters Nariss Siv Loqesh (who resisted the Empire) and Galasett (who enforced Imperial laws brutally), as well as criminal Limna Yith and engineer Pormfil. Some civilized Kerestians were found in recovered sublight colony ships launched before their civilization's fall.",

Their most distinctive feature is their purple skin, which can range from pale to burgundy or mauve, and may shift to blue tones with emotional changes. They have large eyes in colors of red, violet, or black, with proportional eyebrows and eyelashes. Their hair ranges from brown to violet to silver and white, whitening with age. Males may experience thinning or receding hairlines and develop facial hair. Their facial structure includes a dark-purple tongue and white teeth, sometimes with noticeable gaps. Keshiri from different continents show slight phenotypic variations - those from Keshtah have lower foreheads, narrower faces, and smaller, more narrowly set eyes compared to Alanciari Keshiri. Their bodies are humanoid with two arms, two legs, and five-fingered hands with nails.",
    "species_personality": "The Keshiri are deeply religious people who traditionally worshiped the Skyborn as their creators and protectors. They are artistic and creative, with long traditions in crafts like glassblowing and performance arts like pantomime. While initially naive and trusting of beings they believed to be their gods (the Sith), they proved capable of both fierce resistance (as shown by Adari Vaal) and loyal service. They form lifelong pair bonds through marriage, though extramarital affairs do occur. Keshiri find Humans attractive despite biological incompatibility, and were curious about Human skin tone variations. They are scientifically minded enough to have determined their world was round before offworld contact. Their religious nature makes them particularly susceptible to Force-based influences and manipulations.",
    "species_background": "Native to the remote planet Kesh in Wild Space, the Keshiri developed a simple society with circular homes featuring conical thatched roofs before contact with outsiders. Their entire civilization revolved around worship of the Skyborn gods and fear of the Destructors. In 5000 BBY, crashed Sith from the Omen were mistaken for the Skyborn, leading to millennia of Sith rule. A resistance movement led by Adari Vaal warned the Alanciar continent, which militarized in preparation. Though eventually realizing the Sith weren't gods, many Keshiri continued serving them, with some even joining the Sith Tribe's ruling Circle of Lords by 41 ABY. The species remained isolated until the Sith built an armada, allowing Keshiri like High Lord Sarasu Taalon to travel offworld. Their brief galactic exposure ended tragically during conflicts with Jedi and Abeloth, with many Keshiri Sith perishing. The species is known for producing Force-sensitives, particularly from Alanciar, and their glassblowing artistry remains unparalleled.",

These hullepi serve both as respiratory organs and as their means of communication. Khil breathe through different lengths of hullepi to produce various musical tones, making them naturally gifted musicians. Their skin tone remains consistently grayish across their bodies, and they absorb nutrients through their hullepi from organic debris, moisture, and plant juices rather than consuming solid food in the traditional sense.",
    "species_personality": "Khil are dedicated, ambitious individuals with little tolerance for laziness or inefficiency. From infancy, they're taught to work hard and strive for leadership positions, often displaying slight arrogance in their conviction that nothing is beyond their capabilities with sufficient effort. This driven nature can lead to mood swings or nervous breakdowns under extreme stress. However, their intensity is balanced by strong family loyalty and generally polite, friendly demeanors. They value peaceful political solutions but can become devious and vindictive when defending their homes. Khil consider themselves 'citizens of the galaxy' and have integrated well into galactic society, though their ambition sometimes creates friction with other species.",
    "species_background": "The Khil were among the earliest members of the Galactic Republic, spreading to countless worlds over millennia. They enthusiastically supported the Republic's peaceful order while contributing significantly as scientists, soldiers, musicians, entrepreneurs, and politicians. Notable individuals include Jedi Master Xamar (circa 3,964 BBY). Initially supporting the Empire, they found themselves excluded from high government positions due to Humanocentric policies. After the Merakai massacre where Imperial forces killed Khil protesters, many joined the Rebel Alliance. During the Galactic Civil War, Khil provided subtle but crucial support to Rebels through safehouses, supplies, and misinformation. While most resisted quietly, exceptions like Greldo Farnor fought openly after Alderaan's destruction. The Khil were among the first species to join the New Republic and continued supporting it through the Yuuzhan Vong conflict. Their technologically advanced society features cosmopolitan cities with wetland parks valued for both utility and aesthetics.",

They have distinctive purplish-pink heads with large, deep-set eyes and keratin plates protecting their necks. Their most notable facial features are two dangling, tentacle-like olfactory organs. Their bodies are adapted to their marine-based culture, with physical traits that suggest an evolutionary connection to both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Their skin has a slightly scaled texture, remnants of their reptilian ancestry, while their limbs show adaptations for swimming and herding their derlac livestock.",
    "species_personality": "Kian'thar are generally peaceful people who use their empathic abilities to avoid conflicts, though some unscrupulous individuals manipulate emotions to create discord. They value close bonds with both their bentail mounts and family units. The species is divided between traditionalist Iith'lon (Preservers) who maintain their ancestral ways and progressive Lllun who seek galactic integration, though disagreements rarely escalate beyond debates over oceanroot tea. Offworld Kian'thar are known for their wanderlust and strong work ethic, often working as mediators or counselors. Many non-Kian'thar are wary of their emotion-sensing abilities, creating social challenges when interacting with other species.",
    "species_background": "The Kian'thar evolved on Shaum Hii with a culture centered around its oceans and marshes. They were isolated from galactic society until discovered by Shistavanen scouts around 300 BBY due to the difficult navigation of the Tragan Cluster and Bakisian Drift. Their traditional lifestyle involved herding derlacs (large ocean grazers) using bentail flying mounts. From 278-211 BBY they attempted unsuccessfully to colonize Bestine IV. By the Imperial era, nearly two million Kian'thar had left their world, including notable figures like Rebel operative Kkral'Nas and criminal Lleag'Mak. Their technology remained primitive even after galactic contact, with most rejecting sophisticated devices like droids in favor of traditional methods. Their society maintains a delicate balance between preserving traditions and embracing galactic opportunities.",

These markings are passed down maternally in most cases, except when the mother isn't Kiffar, in which case paternal markings are used. Physiologically, they are nearly identical to Humans, with no other notable physical differences beyond their culturally significant facial tattoos. Their bodies show the same range of physical variation as Humans in terms of build, hair color, and other characteristics.",
    "species_personality": "Kiffar culture is deeply clan-oriented, with strong familial ties and traditions. Historically, their clans were often in conflict or tense alliances, though this has diminished since Imperial annexation. They take great pride in their facial markings which signify clan membership. Kiffar with psychometric abilities often develop a philosophical outlook from experiencing the memories of objects. As Near-Humans integrated into galactic society, they exhibit the full range of personality types found in Humans, though often with a stronger sense of clan identity and history. Those with Force sensitivity tend to be particularly introspective due to their psychometric experiences.",
    "species_background": "The Kiffar originate from the twin planets Kiffu and Kiffex in the Kiffu system. About 1% of Kiffar possess psychometry - the ability to read memories from objects through touch. This ability made them valuable investigators and historians. Their society was historically organized around clans identified by distinctive facial tattoos, with clan feuds being common until Imperial annexation 3,500 years before the rise of Darth Vader. Notable Kiffar include Jedi Master Quinlan Vos, who demonstrated the rare ability to read living minds, and his son Korto Vos who inherited his father's markings when his Human mother couldn't pass down the traditional tattoos. The species has diminished in numbers since Imperial occupation but maintains its cultural traditions, particularly the qukuuf marking system that preserves clan lineages.",

They are known for their ferocity in battle, capable of entering berserker-like frenzies. Despite their combat orientation, they are loyal to their employers and take pride in their work as soldiers, mercenaries, and guards. Off the battlefield, they maintain a strong sense of honor and discipline forged from their history of tribal conflicts.

This alien contact profoundly changed their society, prompting them to end their conflicts and migrate offworld. They quickly found niches as soldiers, mercenaries, and laborers throughout the galaxy. Their combat abilities made them particularly valued as warriors, with some wearing traditional green battle armor decorated with feather patterns. The Kilmaulsi's transition from tribal warfare to galactic mercenary work represents a remarkable cultural adaptation, though they maintained their fierce warrior traditions in their new roles. Their history of tribal conflict and subsequent galactic integration has shaped them into disciplined but formidable fighters.",

Their bodies are aerodynamically shaped to withstand windstorms, with nearly invisible small eyes, ears, and mouth that can seal completely. They possess double lungs capable of storing oxygen for up to four hours and olfactory sensors in their feet for detecting prey through sand. Their vanilla-scented bodies move slowly by expanding and contracting foot muscles or slithering prone. Their tough skin and unique physiology make them perfectly adapted to the Kurdan Desert's extreme conditions.",
    "species_personality": "Kitonaks are extraordinarily patient and calm, a psychological adaptation to their hunting method of standing motionless for extended periods. They refuse to be rushed and will deliberately slow down if pressured. Their thought processes are methodical, often taking years to make decisions. They value storytelling as their primary cultural activity, with elaborate tales that can span multiple nights. While generally peaceful, they fear caves (believed to be underworld gateways) and quicksand (home to predators). Their names are typically simple monikers like Anarin, Enkor, or Gorlak, though some adopt more complex names when interacting with other species. They become musicians both by nature and often by circumstance when taken offworld.",
    "species_background": "Native to Kirdo III's Kurdan Desert, Kitonaks live as nomadic tribes following chooba herds, their primary food source. Their society operates as a planet-wide participatory democracy with extremely slow decision-making processes. Every ten years during rare rainfalls, they gather for the Great Celebration of Life where mating occurs through the Dance of Love, though gestation lasts until the next rainy period years later. Young mature by age nine and often wander seeking less crowded tribes, playing chidinkalu flutes to attract company. Many have been abducted by slavers attracted to their music, becoming forced performers in cantinas. Notable individuals include Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band and Jedi trainee around 35 ABY. Their natural patience and stillness also makes them effective spies and information brokers for those willing to wait for their insights.",

    "species_physical_description": "Klatooinians are humanoids standing 1.6 to 2.0 meters tall with leathery, wrinkled skin that ranges in color from greenish to grayish tones. They have pronounced brow ridges, wide noses, and strong jawlines that give them a naturally intimidating appearance. Their muscular builds reflect their history as warriors and laborers, with broad shoulders and thick limbs adapted for physical work. Their hands are large with thick fingers, equally suited for wielding weapons or performing mechanical repairs. Many Klatooinians bear scars or tattoos marking their service to various Hutt kajidics or criminal organizations.",
    "species_personality": "Klatooinians are deeply traditional, valuing patience, tenacity, and the wisdom of elders above all else. Their culture suppresses individuality in favor of communal identity and obedience to authority. Most are fiercely loyal to their masters, particularly the Hutts whom many revere as near-divine figures. However, younger generations inspired by the Rebel Alliance have begun challenging these ancient traditions. Klatooinians typically have names honoring their history (like Barada or M'Beg) or reflecting their roles (Bekure, Drekk, Rokar). Those who break from Hutt service often adopt more individualistic identities while maintaining their species' characteristic physical endurance and mechanical aptitude.",
    "species_background": "Native to Klatooine in the Si'Klaata Cluster, Klatooinians have been bound to the Hutts since signing the Treaty of Vontor circa 25,100 BBY after helping defeat Xim the Despot. Their society revolves around the Fountain of Ancients (later renamed Fountain of Hutt Ancients), a natural glass formation symbolizing their cultural values. Ruled by a Council of Elders, Klatooinians are sold into servitude at age ten, with the most rebellious sent to the harshest conditions. While most served the Hutts as enforcers, mechanics, and guild workers, some became Jedi (like those killed at Geonosis) or joined the Rebel Alliance (like technologist Rolanda Gron). Notable individuals include Jabba's employees Barada (mechanic) and Umpass-stay (bodyguard), as well as dark side adept Profex Rynalla's Klatooinian slavers. Their servitude continued into the New Republic era, though some joined criminal rivals or became Galactic Alliance spies during the Yuuzhan Vong War.",

Their facial features include pronounced snouts and large, mobile ears that enhance their sensory perception.",

They exhibit playful tendencies when comfortable but can become fiercely defensive when threatened.",
    "species_background": "Native to the world of Krann, the Kluuzot evolved as nocturnal arboreal creatures in dense forests. Their physiology reflects adaptations to this environment, including enhanced night vision and climbing abilities. Little is known about their broader societal development, but their physical traits suggest a lifestyle centered around tree-dwelling and nocturnal activity. Their technological development appears limited, focusing on practical tools for survival rather than complex machinery.

They possess three compound eyes (two front, one rear) providing 360-degree vision, with red or orange coloration. Their spiked brows and fuzzy facial carapace allow for expressive communication despite their insectoid mandibles. Each limb ends in natural weapons - four forearm claws and three shin spikes per leg - capable of delivering a potent paralytic venom. Their four-fingered hands and three-toed feet support an angled, forward-leaning posture, while their lightweight frames enable impressive jumping ability (up to half their body length).",
    "species_personality": "Koboks are hardened warriors with calculating, militaristic temperaments shaped by their harsh homeworld and history of conflict. While not inherently malicious, they've developed a galaxy-wide reputation as cunning killers due to their prevalence in mercenary and assassin work. They value combat prowess and strategic thinking, with elite warriors earning honors like the Koboth Insurgent Mantle. Their society emphasizes military discipline, though individuals can be temperamental - some like the pilot Slis Tieeer Dualli were known for violent outbursts against employers. Despite their fearsome reputation, they're capable of complex social structures and trade relations with neighboring species like the Trianii and Hiitians.",
    "species_background": "Native to the radiation-scorched Outer Rim world Koboth, the Koboks developed sublight space travel independently before encountering the wider galaxy. Governed by the Koboth Union, they established Kobothi Space and frequently clashed with the Corporate Alliance, most notably during the Mavvan Conflict which led to creation of the elite Kobothi S-Corps. While never joining the Galactic Republic, they traded with Corellian and Duros explorers via the Hydian Way. Their martial culture produces exceptional soldiers and pilots, though this has led to their stereotype as violent mercenaries. Notable individuals include the Imperial collaborator Gaff and hotheaded pilot Slis Tieeer Dualli. Some Koboks settled on Roon (making up 3% of its population), while Force-sensitive Koboks remain extremely rare. Their language, Kobothi, consists of tonal hisses difficult to translate into Basic.",

Notable Koorivar include Corporate Alliance Magistrate Passel Argente and General Oro Dassyne. They established colonies on worlds like Bomis Koori IV, spreading their mercantile influence. Their society places great importance on the cranial horn as a status symbol, with more elaborate horns typically indicating higher social standing.

They are extremely destructive and curious, loving to explore while rarely leaving their protective packs. They use ceaseless, loud laughter to scare off predators and travel in noisy groups to intimidate jungle creatures. Highly mischievous, they enjoy mocking others, laughing at them, and flinging objects for amusement. They are mean-spirited to both their own kind and other species, often fighting over food instead of sharing. Despite this behavior, they are quite intelligent and can perfectly mimic languages, even communicating in them. They laugh at appropriate times during conversations and can repeat what they hear accurately.",
    "species_background": "Native to the jungle planet Kowak, these creatures resided mainly in large tree nests, swinging through rain forests and scavenging for insects, worms, small rodents, and carrion. Their sentience was debated in the galactic scientific community, though many considered them sentient. They had little structured society beyond nest groups led by the oldest female, with members assigned roles like gathering food or scouting for predators. Reproduction methods were unknown but suspected to involve group egg-laying. Rarely found offworld early in galactic history, they later became associated with criminal organizations due to their mimicry abilities. Some were kept as pets by the upper classes despite being untrainable and destructive. Notable individuals included Jabba the Hutt's jester Salacious B. Crumb and the Force-sensitive mutant Picaroon C. Boodle who served Dark Jedi Jerec before being killed by Kyle Katarn.",

Their bodies are medium-sized, with movement patterns that differ significantly from bipedal species due to their tentacled lower bodies.",
    "species_personality": "Krevaaki tend to be reserved and stoic in their interactions with other species, partly due to their limited facial expressiveness. They are known to be somewhat xenophobic, preferring to conceal their tentacled lower bodies when among bipedal species. Their communication style is direct and they place high value on personal discipline. Notable Krevaaki like Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas demonstrate their capacity for wisdom and spiritual depth, though their natural stoicism can sometimes be misinterpreted as coldness by other species.",
    "species_background": "Native to the planet Krevas, the Krevaaki have produced several notable Force-sensitive individuals throughout galactic history. Most famously, Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas established a Jedi Enclave on Dantooine during the Old Republic era and trained Exar Kun. His descendant Bodo Baas was also part of a Jedi group in the Adega system around 600 BBY. The Krevaaki's unique physiology has led to some isolation from mainstream galactic society, with many choosing to conceal their lower bodies when interacting with bipedal species.

Their society values crystal garden artistry (created via telekinesis or tail-manipulated stir-sticks) and hunting music.

Notable individuals include crime lord Qa'till of Hypotria, who monopolized starship maintenance operations and killed a Rebel operative. Females bear litters called 'worms', with litter size proportional to maternal length (1 worm at 2m, up to 20 at 8m). Growth continues throughout life, with males reaching 10m and females capped at 8m (possibly due to telekinetic energy expenditure).",

Their smooth skin is typically gray-toned, ranging from very dark to very light.

Their settlements are built in elevated locations like treetops and mountain sides, reflecting their ancestral connection to flight.",

They take immense pride in piloting skills and often personalize their flying vehicles. Social status is frequently tied to flight proficiency. Their artistic expressions focus on aerial motifs, and they view grounded transportation as primitive. While generally friendly, they can be dismissive of species that don't share their aerial perspective. The decoration of their cartilaginous facial features is an important cultural practice, with intricate piercing patterns and skin dyes indicating social standing and personal achievements.",

However, their species demonstrated remarkable aptitude for mechanized flight once the technology was developed. Nearly all Lafrarians own personal flying speeders or aircraft, with land and water transport being rare. Their civilization developed around elevated habitats, creating cities in locations inaccessible to flightless species. This airborne culture has made them natural pilots, with many serving as starfighter pilots or ship captains when venturing offworld. Their settlements feature open-air designs that accommodate constant aerial traffic, and their architecture emphasizes verticality and landing platforms.",

Frequent conflicts between city-states and tribes created a strong mercenary tradition.

Notable Lasat include the bounty hunter Puggles Trodd and ˛˛˛[should we reference Zeb Orrelios from Star Wars Rebels here if expanding beyond original ˛˛˛source material?].

The species exhibits minimal sexual dimorphism beyond slight size variations. Their hands have five dexterous digits suited for delicate genetic work. Lurrians move with a gentle, deliberate gait, a reflection of their peaceful nature. Their average lifespan is notably long, with many living over a standard century.",

Curious and inventive by nature, they channel their intellect into bioengineering rather than traditional technology. They take great joy in recreational activities and artistic expression, particularly in the manipulation of living organisms. Their long lifespans contribute to a patient, methodical approach to problem-solving. While generally trusting, their experiences with slavery have made them wary of outsiders, especially humans. They communicate in soft, melodic tones and often express themselves through subtle body language and eye movements.",
    "species_background": "Native to the resource-poor but biodiverse world of Lur in the Outer Rim, the Lurrians developed an entirely biotechnology-based civilization. Without access to conventional materials, they mastered genetic engineering, creating specialized lifeforms for construction, transportation, and defense. Their cities housed thousands in harmony with engineered ecosystems. The Empire enslaved many Lurrians for their genetic expertise after the Clone Wars, though most refused to cooperate. In a famous incident, a young Han Solo freed a group of 50 enslaved Lurrians from traffickers Zlarb and Magg. The species' most notable creations include the Asgnat and Grebnar species. Despite their technological naivete, their bioengineering skills made them valuable targets for exploitation, leading to their continued isolationist tendencies for self-preservation.",

They enjoy adventure, high stakes, and chance-taking, which makes them natural entrepreneurs.

Their flat, tundra-covered homeworld with scarce oases forced them to develop a nomadic lifestyle to find resources and avoid subterranean predators. After contact with the Republic between 3,000-1,000 BBY, they gradually integrated with galactic society, particularly after explorer Ecclessis Figg established the Lutrillian Cross trade route around 400 BBY. This led to technological advancement and the creation of massive wheeled platform-cities that roam Lutrillia's equator. Their society is organized around these mobile cities, each governed by independent councils. Primary exports include ochroid dust while they import high-tech mechanical parts. Throughout galactic history, Lutrillians have spread across the Outer Rim as entrepreneurs, bureaucrats, and adventurers, with notable individuals like General Solomahal during the Clone Wars and business leaders like Treva Horme on Bespin.",

They possess leathery, tough skin and snake-like heads with powerful jaws. Their most distinctive feature is their extremely long arms that often drag along the ground when walking. Their formidable physical presence includes sharp claws and teeth designed for combat. As a primitive species, they lack technological sophistication but make up for it with raw physical power and natural weapons. Their size and appearance make them naturally intimidating creatures.",
    "species_personality": "Savrips are naturally inclined toward combat and physical confrontation. Though often mistaken for non-sentient creatures due to their primitive technology and unusual language, they are intelligent beings capable of learning Basic. Their communication style and combat-focused nature have led many to underestimate their intelligence. Savrips who interact with galactic society often face prejudice and are frequently hunted or exploited. Some individuals have risen above these challenges, with rare examples joining organizations like the Sith Order. Their personalities tend to be direct and physical, with less emphasis on subtlety or diplomacy.",
    "species_background": "Native to Ord Mantell, the Mantellian Savrips were long misunderstood by other species who often dismissed them as non-sentient animals. This misconception allowed figures like Warlord Taxer Sundown to blame crimes on Savrips. Their meat was considered a delicacy by some, leading to attempts at farming them that were thwarted by Jedi intervention. By the Imperial era, few Savrips remained on their homeworld due to hunting and exportation. Despite their primitive nature, some notable Savrips emerged in galactic history, including Kalhar on Tatooine and one who joined Darth Krayt's Sith Order. The species also became known through the Savrip dejarik holomonster. Their story is one of misunderstanding and exploitation, with rare individuals breaking free from these constraints.",

Their alien psychology makes them universally feared and avoided by other Kathol species, as their minds cannot be read or understood through conventional means - attempts at telepathy register only overwhelming hunger.",

After the Rift Disaster, the DarkStryder attempted to discard them in the Segmi tunnels due to their amoral nature, but they adapted and flourished in this underground environment. Like other Kathol creations, they developed an affinity with Ta-Ree life energy, which they use to immobilize prey. Their primary method of feeding involves forcing themselves into a victim's body and digesting organs from within. This horrific feeding behavior, combined with their alien psychology, has made them outcasts even among the other unusual species of Kathol.

They have small eyes that are supplemented by sensory stalks growing near the corners of their large mouths. Their bodies feature long, thin arms, short thick legs, and stubby tails. The most recognizable feature is the thin silver band of cybernetic hardware wrapping around the back of their heads, marking their extensive neural implants. They range in height from 1.4 to 2.3 meters tall, with an average around 1.85 meters. Their physical movements often appear slightly clumsy due to their minds operating faster than their bodies can respond.",
    "species_personality": "Marasans tend to be highly logical and efficient in their thinking, a result of their cybernetic enhancements. Their rapid thought processes sometimes make them seem tactless or quirky to other species, as they often begin speaking before fully considering their words. They value efficiency and technological advancement, with their entire society built around their neural implants. Communication between Marasans is often silent and instantaneous through their cybernetic network, making verbal communication with outsiders seem slow and cumbersome by comparison. Their government operates with remarkable efficiency due to the interconnected Mindnet linking all Electnodes.",
    "species_background": "The Marasans developed in isolation within the Marasa Nebula, protected by the nebula's energized gas that forced trade routes to avoid the region. This isolation allowed them to develop a peaceful, technologically advanced society focused on mathematics and cybernetics to navigate their challenging environment. Their breakthrough in hyperdrive technology enabled travel through the nebula. This isolation ended when the Galactic Empire discovered them and sought to exploit their unique astrogation abilities. The Empire developed cruel 'resonator' weapons to torture the Marasans through their implants, forcing their surrender. Of their twelve billion population, only a few hundred escaped Imperial control to seek help from the Rebel Alliance, though the Rebellion was cautious about intervening due to risk of collective punishment against the Marasans.",

They formed the warrior caste of Sith society and much of the Sith Empire's military. After the Great Hyperspace War (5,000 BBY), Naga Sadow experimented on Massassi followers on Yavin 4, transforming them into dark side-wielding savages who worshipped him as a god. Later, Exar Kun enslaved them to build temples and drained their life forces in a ritual. Though largely extinct by the Rise of the Empire era, some survived on remote worlds or as isolated individuals. The last known Massassi, Kalgrath, traveled to Ziost. Their legacy includes impressive temple architecture and a reputation as formidable warriors.",

Young Melodies have humanoid forms with legs, while adults (called Elders) have mermaid-like forms with tails. Their skin tones blend with Yavin 8's purple mountain environment. Young Melodies must survive dangerous predators like avrils, raiths, reels and purellas before their transformation. Adults live in deep underground lakes but can briefly surface to communicate, except for the very oldest who are permanently aquatic.",

They maintain strong intergenerational bonds despite adults living underwater. Their society preserves history through 'Keepers of Legends' storytellers. While generally peaceful, they are resilient survivors in Yavin 8's harsh environment. They show compassion to outsiders in need, as demonstrated when they tried to help the desperate Massassi parents. Force-sensitive Melodies like Lyric demonstrate curiosity and willingness to learn from other cultures at the Jedi Praxeum.",

The species remained isolated until discovered by Rodian explorer Suz Tanwa (0 BBY) and later the Jedi Praxeum (22 ABY). Force-sensitive Melodie Lyric studied at the Praxeum before returning for her Changing Ceremony. The Yuuzhan Vong invasion likely devastated their population when Voxyn were unleashed on Yavin 8, killing Lyric. Their current status is unknown, though survivor Sannah attended the Conclave on Zonama Sekot (30 ABY).",

They possess long arms that nearly reach the ground when standing, lean legs adapted for climbing, and opposable digits on both hands and feet. Their most distinctive features are their large black eyes (similar to Bith eyes) that provide excellent night vision but cannot perceive colors. While not as physically strong as Humans, they are more agile in arboreal and aquatic environments. Their lifespan is relatively short at 55 standard years, with adulthood reached by age 10. Menahuun can hold their breath for extended periods underwater despite not being fully amphibious.",
    "species_personality": "Originally peaceful hunter-gatherers, Menahuun became fiercely territorial and aggressive after being hunted nearly to extinction. They developed a warrior culture with ritualized combat to resolve conflicts, preferring duels to all-out war when possible. Highly protective of their homeworld, they initially viewed all outsiders with suspicion and hostility. However, they maintain a strong sense of honor and respect for tradition. Their society values cunning, stealth, and survival skills, with shamans holding special status as keepers of 'Pa'ela' (their term for the Force). While technologically primitive, they proved adaptable when exposed to galactic technology during their time in the Hua'Bal mines.",
    "species_background": "Native to Lamaredd (which they call 'Great Menahua'), the Menahuun lived peacefully until corporate scout Hugo Bartyn arrived in 529 BBY and nearly exterminated them for mining rights. Forced into hiding, they developed a more aggressive culture while secretly observing the invaders. After centuries in exile, they discovered pollution from mining operations was destroying their new home. Returning to their ancestral lands, they occupied an abandoned mine (Hua'Bal) and prepared for war. A confrontation in 29 BBY led to peaceful integration into galactic society after proving their sentience. Their history includes capturing a dark Jedi (Byrch Dyshkava) and eventually making peace with Bartyn's descendants through ritual combat. While most remain on Lamaredd, some have ventured into the galaxy.",

Females, by contrast, demonstrate the emotional control and temperament necessary for leadership positions. This dichotomy has resulted in a culture where all political and diplomatic functions are exclusively handled by female Mephouts. The species appears to have embraced this division of roles, developing social structures that accommodate these innate temperamental differences between genders.",

Their homeworld was explored sometime between 1000 BBY and 25 BBY, bringing them into contact with the wider galaxy. Their most notable contribution to galactic technology is the RST Model Translator Droid, which was designed to resemble their species' physical form. Beyond this, little is recorded about their technological development or historical events.

They perceive their environment through Force sight rather than regular vision, which is so acute they can see Force energy radiating from Force-sensitive beings. Their vision doesn't perceive color. They often create illusions to appear as if they have normal eyes or conceal their appearance with headbands or masks. As Near-Humans, they can interbreed with baseline Humans though such unions may cause unknown difficulties for offspring. They typically stand between 1.6-1.8 meters tall.",
    "species_personality": "Miraluka are thoughtful, cautious, and deliberative by nature, with little interest in personal gain or glory. They are deeply united as a species, considering themselves part of one great family and addressing each other as 'brothers.' As a Force-sensitive species, they are often shocked when encountering lifeforms not connected to the Force. They follow the philosophy of The Greater Force, worshiping the twin gods Ashla and Bogan without concepts of good or evil, instead accepting both life and death as natural parts of existence.",
    "species_background": "Originally from an unknown homeworld rendered uninhabitable, the Miraluka adopted Alpheridies as their new home. Their colony world Katarr was devastated by Darth Nihilus in 3,952 BBY during a Jedi convocation. Many Miraluka are drawn to the Jedi Order, serving as Jedi, teachers, and administrators. While rare, some have fallen to the dark side like Dark Jedi Jerec. Notable Miraluka include Visas Marr, survivor of Katarr; Shoaneb Culu, a Jedi Shadow; and the Draay family members with Miraluka heritage. Their society was profoundly affected by the Battle of Malachor V, which even the Katarr Miraluka could sense.",

Known as master starship designers, they originally built luxurious passenger liners before converting to military vessels for the Rebel Alliance. The Empire enslaved their world, leading to their pivotal role in the Rebellion - providing both Admiral Ackbar's strategic genius and their famous Star Cruisers.

They have mottled yellow skin, six stubby legs, and distinctive spoon-billed snouts filled with wide, flat teeth for chewing vegetation. Their most notable physical characteristic is the nutrient-rich slime they constantly secrete from glands in their underbellies, leaving a visible trail as they move. Their massive size and unusual appearance often leads them to be mistaken for wild beasts rather than intelligent beings.",
    "species_personality": "Morodins are peaceful, intellectually curious beings focused on agricultural development and biochemical experimentation. They possess a strong communal spirit and are eager to cooperate with other species, though their attempts at communication are often misunderstood. Patient and methodical, they approach agriculture as both a practical necessity and an intellectual exercise, using their 'maze-running' fertilization patterns to teach younger generations. Despite being hunted by other species, they maintain a fundamentally benevolent disposition and don't associate individual hunters with the farmers they try to help.",
    "species_background": "The Morodins originated from an unknown homeworld, colonizing Varonat approximately 1,000 years before the Old Republic's formation to create an agricultural colony. They transformed Varonat's plains into the Great Jungle through their biochemical agriculture. After an ecological disaster cut them off from their homeworld, they remained on Varonat continuing their agricultural experiments. Human colonists later misinterpreted their agricultural activities as destructive behavior, leading to widespread hunting. The Empire exploited them further through safari hunts until the New Republic outlawed such practices. Their civilization maintains advanced knowledge of biochemical agriculture despite lacking traditional cities or technology.",

They stand between 1.5 to 1.7 meters tall with slender builds resembling human adolescents. Their most striking feature is their semitransparent greenish skin that reveals internal organs and blood flow. Their conical heads are covered in scaled plates of various colors (brown, gray, white, green, purple, or tan) and feature large black eyes without visible pupils, small noses, and thin triangular mouths. The upper pair of arms are similar in size to human arms, while the lower pair extending from secondary shoulders are slightly smaller. Their hands have varying numbers of digits (3-5) with opposable thumbs. In oxygen environments, they wear form-fitting environment suits with methane-supplying breath masks that give their voices a mechanical quality.",
    "species_personality": "Morseerians are intensely private, introverted beings who value secrecy above all else. They are laconic and prefer to avoid confrontation, though will defend themselves if threatened. Their culture maintains an obsessive protection of their homeworld's location, with members willing to die rather than reveal it. While generally reserved, they demonstrate loyalty to trusted trading partners like the Squibs. Their society operates under a complex client-patron relationship with the Drackmarians, honoring contracts with strict adherence. Those who break agreements face severe consequences from both Drackmarian overlords and their own people.",
    "species_background": "Native to an unknown methane-rich world in the Outer Rim, Morseerians have maintained their homeworld's secrecy for over 12,000 years. They established colonies including Morseer (from which they derive their common name) and developed unique starship designs supporting methane atmospheres. Following conflict with the Drackmarians, they became a client species within the Quelii sector. During the Galactic Civil War, Imperial attempts to locate their homeworld drove many to secretly support the Rebel Alliance, though few openly joined. Notable Morseerians include the smuggler Nabrun Leids and informant leader Chall Bekan. Their society produces skilled traders and spacers who operate primarily in the Outer Rim, often crewed by fellow methane-breathers like Chadra-Fan and Gand.",

They have thick, moist skin that ranges in color from mottled gray to light blue. Their physique features a short but very wide torso, muscular legs, and thin, long arms. Trailing from their forearms and legs are thick membranes that aid in swimming. Each limb ends with three digits. They typically stand between 1.6 to 2.0 meters tall. Their amphibious nature requires them to keep their skin moist and limits their reproduction to aquatic environments.",
    "species_personality": "The Multopos are generally peaceful in new encounters unless attacked first. They approach curious visitors openly and attempt to communicate in a pidgin version of Basic, having had many positive dealings with offworlders. While not inherently warlike, they are practical about defense and have quickly adapted to galactic technology, particularly showing interest in advanced weapons to protect themselves from their aquatic enemies, the Krikthasi.",
    "species_background": "The Multopos are indigenous to the planet Baralou, where they populate the tropical islands. Their society places great importance on reproduction and raising young, as their amphibious nature requires mating and egg development to occur in water. They are engaged in a constant vicious war with the Krikthasi, another sentient species of Baralou that steals Multopos eggs for food. Some Multopos tribes armed with traded blasters have begun actively hunting Krikthasi beneath the sea. The species has shown remarkable adaptability to off-world technology while maintaining their traditional ways of life.",

The Murachaun resisted Imperial rule through covert rebellion. Under subsequent governments, the Ktilac Regions maintained their Allied Region status.

The southern Mustafarians are shorter (averaging 1.5 meters) but stockier and more physically resilient. Both subspecies have hard exoskeletal plates covering leathery skin, long snouts, and insectoid eyes. Their unique physiology contains very little water, making them exceptionally adapted to their harsh homeworld. Southern Mustafarians can withstand higher temperatures than their northern counterparts and wear specialized breath masks and thick armor when working near lava flows.",
    "species_personality": "Mustafarians are an egocentric and insular species, primarily concerned with extracting resources from their volcanic world. They show little interest in galactic affairs unless it involves trade or business opportunities. While not naturally aggressive, they are fiercely protective of their territory and resources. Their culture is highly symbolic, with architecture based on cave fungi shapes and manhood rituals involving dangerous lava flea riding. They communicate in a buzzing, insectoid language and maintain a practical, survival-oriented mindset shaped by their extreme environment.",
    "species_background": "The Mustafarians evolved from extremophilic arthropods in Mustafar's volcanic caves. About 300 years before the Clone Wars, they established a trade relationship with the Techno Union, gaining technology that improved their living conditions in exchange for mineral resources. This led to their involvement with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, who used Mustafar as a headquarters. After the Clone Wars, they briefly gained control of a Separatist fortress before its destruction by the Empire. Notable Mustafarians include Chief Armstrong, Foreman Chivos, and bounty hunter Urup Fal'co. Their society revolves around lava mining operations, with northerners often serving as sentries and southerners handling the more physically demanding mining work. They live in saucer-shaped buildings near mine entrances, often extending into abandoned mine shafts or dormant volcanoes.",

During the Clone Wars, IGBC Chairman San Hill secretly supported the Separatists while maintaining Republic ties, leading to the devastating Battle of Muunilinst.

Their four arms (one primary hand and three off-hands) make them exceptional climbers and allow versatile weapon handling. Their small feet with several large toes provide stability in their native arboreal environment. After the Ossus Project disaster, some Myneyrshi mutated into hulking gray-skinned variants with jagged protrusions covering their bodies.",

Their culture emphasizes spiritual strength and resistance to mental domination, as demonstrated when they resisted Joruus C'baoth's control. While warlike with their traditional Psadan enemies, they are cautious against technologically superior foes.

Myneyrshi value oral traditions over written records and maintain a strong connection to their homeworld's ecology.",

Their history includes periods of conflict with Human colonists, Imperial enslavement under Emperor Palpatine's Mount Tantiss storehouse project, and oppression by the mad clone Joruus C'baoth. The Yuuzhan Vong invasion devastated their population, with survivors either fleeing as refugees or retreating into Wayland's forests. The failed Ossus Project terraforming attempt in 126 ABY caused catastrophic mutations among remaining Myneyrshi populations. Their society is hunter-gatherer based with strong shamanistic traditions and an aversion to technology stemming from Imperial occupation. Notable individuals include Chieftain Roax and resistance leader Txer. Despite their isolationism, a few Myneyrshi have ventured offworld, such as a Clone Wars-era landspeeder pilot on Drongar.",

    "species_personality": "Nagai are driven by an intense sense of personal honor and martial pride, though individual personalities vary within this framework. They fear little except loss of freedom and typically care only for their own family units unless honor-bound to others. Their culture fosters a belief in their racial superiority, leading many to view other species as inferior and suitable for enslavement. Despite this arrogance, they are capable of forming alliances when necessary, particularly against their ancient enemies, the Tofs. Nagai value directness in communication and have a particular talent for persuasive speech.",
    "species_background": "The Nagai originated in the Firefist satellite galaxy on their homeworld Nagi. Their early development of superluminal travel inadvertently led to their discovery and conquest by the Tofs, beginning centuries of guerilla warfare. This conflict eventually forced their expansion into the main Star Wars galaxy (which they call the Skyriver) around 4 ABY. Under Dark Lady Lumiya's guidance, they attempted to exploit the post-Endor chaos to establish footholds on worlds like Kashyyyk, Kinooine, and Zeltros. After initial conflicts with both the Rebel Alliance and Imperial Remnant, they ultimately allied with these factions against their mutual Tof enemies. Following the Tof surrender, most Nagai returned to liberate their homeworld while some settled on Saijo. Their society produces skilled warriors and has occasionally contributed Force-sensitive individuals to the Jedi Order.",

Their most notable features include long mane-like hair, whiskery beards, and wide mouths filled with sharp teeth.

This combination of traits makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous adversaries when provoked.",
    "species_background": "The Najib evolved from cave-dwelling primates on their homeworld Najiba, eventually migrating to the planet's wetlands. Their isolation was maintained by the dangerous 'Children of Najiba' asteroid belt that restricted travel during half of their elliptical orbit. Even after contact with the Galactic Republic in its later years, Najiba remained largely isolated due to these natural barriers. The Najib developed a unique tribal government system where representatives from local tribes formed a 'governing tribe' to handle interstellar affairs. While technologically limited to feudal-level production, they participated in galactic trade when possible. Their world became known for criminal activity and popular swoop racing in the Byzal canyon. Cave paintings from their primitive ancestors would later be rediscovered, providing insights into their early development.",

Their appearance is often unsettling to other species, contributing to their isolation in galactic society. Nalrithians hatch from communal egg clutches, with eggmates sharing a telepathic bond from birth.",
    "species_personality": "Nalrithians are deeply communal with their eggmates but typically xenophobic toward other species. The shared consciousness among eggmates creates an intense group mentality that outsiders find difficult to understand or penetrate. Most Nalrithians are bitter and distrustful of other species due to widespread discrimination against their insectoid appearance. They prefer to work in groups with their eggmates when possible, forming tight-knit units that operate with near-perfect coordination. Notable exceptions like bounty hunter Cypher Bos demonstrate that individual Nalrithians can operate outside their typical social structures when necessary.",

Their most notable appearance in recorded history was bounty hunter Cypher Bos's near-successful attempt to kill Han Solo during the Rebel Alliance's first mission to Ord Mantell. Their hive-like social structure and telepathic abilities make them formidable when working in groups, though their insectoid appearance causes most other species to avoid them. Little is known about their homeworld or broader societal structures, as they rarely share this information with outsiders.

The merchant guilds carefully manage relations between these groups, distributing wealth while limiting offworld influence.

They have large black or dark maroon eyes with seldom-used eyelids and fourteen sensory head-tresses that serve as major sensory organs. These tendrils enhance their exceptional olfactory and pheromone sensing abilities, particularly underwater. Nautolans possess multiple hearts capable of beating separately and have physiology optimized for aquatic life, including low light vision and excellent swimming capabilities. Their language is maximized for underwater use, becoming less pronounceable in air, forcing most to speak Anselmian or Galactic Basic off-world. Their eyes feature distinctive swirl patterns that serve as additional communicative cues when submerged.",
    "species_personality": "Nautolan personality is deeply influenced by their enhanced sensory capabilities, particularly their ability to detect pheromones and emotional states through their head-tresses. This makes them highly attuned to interpersonal dynamics. Their communication style is nuanced, with emphasis on non-verbal cues when underwater. Few Nautolans leave their homeworld, making those who do particularly adaptable to alien cultures. They have a strong artistic tradition, especially in music which features sustained notes in irregular patterns with meaningful pauses. Nautolans value these pauses as much as the notes themselves, a subtlety often lost on other species.",
    "species_background": "Native to the aquatic world Glee Anselm, most Nautolan civilization was concentrated in the Sabilon Region. While they established settlements across their planet, few ventured offworld. Notable exceptions include Jedi Master Kit Fisto who served during the Clone Wars, the Gynt Jedi dynasty, and the criminal Dossa who played a role in the Great Sith War. Nautolan music is prized by collectors, though often misunderstood. After the Battle of Yavin, Nautolan warriors led by Overlord Rrynt'vor controlled Station Gamma in the Bright Jewel system. Their society remains largely mysterious to outsiders, as their sensory-rich aquatic communication doesn't translate well to air-breathing environments.",

Their physical stature and agility reflect their noble bearing and contemplative nature.",
    "species_personality": "Nazzar are deeply spiritual and philosophical, following the strict Ulizra religion which emphasizes group importance over the individual. They are naturally xenophobic and distrustful of outsiders, believing foreign influences could taint their culture. Those who overcome this prejudice make exceptionally loyal companions. Nazzar society values contemplation and adherence to religious tenets above all else. Offworld Nazzar are typically either outcasts or preachers seeking to spread Ulizra teachings, though the latter rarely find acceptance. They maintain a dignified, noble demeanor and approach life with serious contemplation. Once a Nazzar commits to a relationship or cause, they demonstrate fanatical loyalty.",
    "species_background": "Native to the Mid Rim planet Nazzri, this species joined the Galactic Republic early in its history but maintained isolationist tendencies. Their government evolved from a monarchy to an oligarchical theocracy led by a king and fourteen religious praefects. The Nazzar largely ignored galactic affairs, including the rise of the Empire and Yuuzhan Vong invasion. Their entire history is preserved in the Hall of Edification on Nazzri. Notable Nazzar include Jedi Knight Qrrrl Toq, who fought in the Great Sith War, and Princess Ikree who opposed her father's dark magic corruption. Most Nazzar remain on their homeworld, with only those on spiritual journeys (boqeri) or outcasts venturing offworld. Their language shares the species' name, and they also speak Galactic Basic. Despite their isolation, some Nazzar have played roles in galactic history as Jedi, soldiers, and even slaves caught in larger conflicts.",

Neimoidians have five fingers and two claw-like toes. Born in larval 'grub' form, they develop into adults through a harsh selection process. Their bodies desiccate rapidly after death, with faces elongating and brain sacs shriveling - a look that inspired Trade Federation battle droid designs. They are notorious disease carriers, with their homeworld frequently quarantined.",
    "species_personality": "Neimoidians are stereotypically greedy, cowardly, and obsessed with wealth and status. They place tremendous value on material possessions and will scheme extensively for profit. Highly fearful of death and physical danger, they avoid combat whenever possible. Their upbringing in competitive grub hives fosters ruthless self-interest. Neimoidians struggle with concepts like loyalty and often betray allies for personal gain. They are acutely status-conscious, using elaborate clothing and hats to signify rank. While skilled in business and negotiation, their reputation for corruption is widespread. Under pressure, they become visibly stressed, with their lung pods convulsing dramatically.",
    "species_background": "Descended from Duros colonists around 25,000 BBY, Neimoidians became a distinct species due to their planet's heavier gravity and dim star. They established wealthy 'purse worlds' like Cato Neimoidia. In 350 BBY, they helped found the Trade Federation, which they came to dominate completely by 33 BBY after Darth Sidious eliminated non-Neimoidian leadership. Their blockade of Naboo cemented their reputation for greed and cowardice. During the Clone Wars, they aligned with the Separatists, leading to Republic attacks on their worlds. Under the Empire, they attempted to distance themselves from their Trade Federation legacy by adopting Duros cultural elements. Their society raises grubs in brutal communal hives, with only the strongest surviving to adulthood. Most adults work in corporate structures like the Trade Federation, while weaker individuals remain on Neimoidia.",

While initially wary of outsiders, they show deep loyalty to those who earn their trust.

This event led to permanent physical changes in subsequent generations of males, who inherited the enhanced traits of their mutant ancestors.

Their foliage is typically brownish or black, growing on their upper bodies. They can dramatically alter their size and shape, ranging from 2 to 9.5 meters tall, with their resting form being about 5 meters tall. Their forms vary from humanoid to treelike masses. As photosynthetic organisms, they require only one-tenth the water of most species but need regular sunlight. Neti have extremely long lifespans, often living several thousand years, and reproduce only once every few centuries. Their seeds can remain dormant for over a millennium before germinating. All Neti are naturally Force-sensitive, with their plant biology allowing them to enter deep hibernation trances when necessary.",
    "species_personality": "Neti are contemplative and patient beings, their long lifespans giving them a unique perspective on time and events. They tend to be wise and thoughtful, with many becoming Jedi or scholars. Their shapeshifting abilities make them adaptable to different situations, though they often prefer simpler, more natural forms. As a species, they value knowledge and harmony with nature. Their infrequent reproduction and small population numbers make each Neti particularly precious to their kind, fostering a strong sense of community among them. They approach problems with the patience of plants that have witnessed centuries pass, rarely acting in haste.",
    "species_background": "First encountered on the planet Ryyk approximately 4,000 years before the Battle of Yavin, the Neti originally came from an unknown homeworld before migrating to Myrkr and later Ryyk. Their population has always remained small due to their long lifespans and infrequent reproduction. After Ryyk's destruction, Jedi Master Ood Bnar was the only known Neti survivor offworld, though dormant seeds may exist elsewhere. A clan of Neti lived on Nerit, a moon of Ossus. By the Legacy era, the species was considered mythical. Notable Neti include several Jedi Masters (Garnoo, Ood Bnar, T'ra Saa) and the Sith librarian Dail'Liss. Their shapeshifting abilities and Force sensitivity made them both respected and mysterious figures in galactic history.",

All Nikto share leathery skin, often with spikes or horns, and eyes with protective membranes. The Kajain'sa'Nikto (Red Nikto) have forehead ridges, facial horns, and breathing tubes adapted for desert life. Kadas'sa'Nikto (Green Nikto) feature climbing claws and facial horns. Esral'sa'Nikto (Mountain Nikto) have large facial fins for heat regulation and improved hearing. Gluss'sa'Nikto (Pale Nikto) combine traits with white-gray skin and smaller fins. M'shento'su'Nikto (Southern Nikto) have large breathing tubes that double as ultrasonic sensors. Nikto range from 1.6-1.9 meters tall and have limited facial expressiveness due to their musculature.",
    "species_personality": "Nikto are often underestimated due to their stoic expressions, but are intelligent and adaptable. Their culture historically revolved around the Cult of M'dweshuu before swearing allegiance to the Hutts. They value strength and loyalty, having served as warriors and bodyguards for millennia. Different subspecies retain cultural traits from their native environments - desert survival for Red Nikto, climbing skills for Green Nikto, etc. Nikto tend to be pragmatic and resilient, shaped by their harsh homeworld and long service to the Hutts. While often seen as brutish enforcers, many have broken from this mold to become independent operators or even Jedi.",
    "species_background": "Native to Kintan in the Si'Klaata Cluster, Nikto civilization developed under the influence of the dying star M'dweshuu. Around 25,130 BBY they were conquered by the Hutts and bound by the Treaty of Vontor, serving as soldiers and bodyguards for millennia. They fought in the Hutt-Xim conflict and later appeared throughout Hutt-controlled space. Several Nikto became Jedi, including Ima-Gun Di during the Clone Wars. Under the Empire, many worked for Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine. Their subspecies developed distinct adaptations: Red Nikto to deserts, Green Nikto to forests, Mountain Nikto to high altitudes, Pale Nikto to islands, and Southern Nikto to varied southern climates. Despite Hutt domination, Nikto have periodically asserted independence, especially after Jabba's death in 4 ABY.",

Their hands have four digits with opposable thumbs, well-suited for paperwork and data manipulation. Their eyes are large and forward-facing, providing good depth perception for their bureaucratic work. While physically unremarkable compared to many species, their evolutionary development of problem-solving skills is reflected in their high foreheads and expressive facial features that convey complex social cues important in their bureaucratic culture.",
    "species_personality": "Nimbanels are highly intelligent and analytical, with a cultural obsession for complex problem-solving and bureaucracy. They approach conflicts through logic puzzles and paperwork rather than physical confrontation, a tradition stemming from their muhndee competitions. Exceptionally detail-oriented, they pride themselves on navigating and creating complex systems. Their competitive nature manifests in information hoarding and bureaucratic one-upmanship rather than violence. While generally peaceful, they can be fiercely competitive in professional settings. Many Nimbanels working for the Hutts maintain a careful balance between serving their employers and preserving their own interests, demonstrating political savvy honed through generations of clan rivalries.",
    "species_background": "Native to Nimban, this species evolved problem-solving skills to access food from tricky plants like puzzleflowers. Their society developed complex bureaucracy as an alternative to warfare, settling disputes through muhndee logic competitions. After achieving spaceflight, they joined the Republic but later voluntarily allied with the Hutts when the Krovalis clan negotiated a deal with Zochaeb the Hutt. This unique arrangement made them the only species to willingly enter Hutt service while maintaining considerable autonomy. Nimbanels became galaxy-renowned bureaucrats, working for governments, corporations (like Hoersch-Kessel Drive), and criminal organizations alike. Notable individuals include Mosep Binneed, Jabba the Hutt's accountant. Their expertise in data systems led to clan rivalries over control of Bureau of Ships and Services records, ultimately resulting in their special relationship with the Hutts.",

Their anatomy features four multi-jointed arms for tool use and brachiation through their jungle homeworld's canopy, along with two powerful legs. Each Noehon has unique scent glands near their mouth that produce a persistent musky odor used for marking possessions and territory. Their bodies are adapted to hanging upside-down, granting natural resistance to motion sickness and disorientation in zero-gravity environments. The species' soft exoskeleton provides moderate protection while maintaining flexibility for their arboreal lifestyle.",

They are intensely possessive, meticulously organizing and scent-marking their belongings. Offworld Noehons often retain these organizational skills but display less aggression, adapting better to galactic society. All Noehons instinctively understand social hierarchies, bullying subordinates while fawning over superiors.

Even civilized Noehons tend to be fastidious and somewhat obsessive about their possessions and workspaces.",

They never achieved spaceflight independently but became involved in galactic affairs through slave trading. Visitors exchanged advanced technology for Noehon slaves and resources, exacerbating inter-weld conflicts. While most remain on their homeworld, many Noehons were taken as slaves or became slavers themselves, like Tir'uh of the Mytaranor Slaving Council. During the Galactic Civil War, their nature suited Imperial needs, while others like Captain Hark'r used their organizational skills to aid the Rebel Alliance.

They possess prominent fangs and claws natural for hunting, along with large, quick-moving eyes that provide excellent vision. Their most remarkable feature is an extremely acute sense of smell capable of identifying bloodlines - they recognized Leia Organa Solo as Darth Vader's daughter by scent alone. Their bodies are perfectly designed killing machines, with every physical attribute serving their predatory nature. A subspecies called Gengh-Noghri developed separately from those on Honoghr.",

They value honor above all else, maintaining strict loyalty to their clan and leaders. Their culture revolves around the dukha (community buildings) at the center of each village. Noghri speak in guttural, scratchy tones and prefer primitive weapons like knives, though they train with modern arms when necessary. They are single-minded in completing missions, becoming completely consumed by objectives until accomplished. While fearsome in combat, they make exceptional bodyguards due to their unwavering dedication. Their society is matriarchal, with maitrakhs serving as storytellers and lore-keepers for each clan.",
    "species_background": "Native to Honoghr, the Noghri were enslaved by the Rakata before developing an agrarian culture. Their world was devastated during the Clone Wars by Separatist toxins, leaving them vulnerable when Darth Vader discovered them. Impressed by their warrior skills after they killed his stormtroopers, Vader manipulated them into Imperial service by falsely promising ecological aid while secretly keeping their planet poisoned. They became the Empire's elite Death Commandos until Leia Organa Solo revealed the deception, after which they transferred loyalty to her as 'Lady Vader'. The New Republic helped resettle some Noghri to allow Honoghr to recover. Noghri society is clan-based, with notable clans including Bakh'tor and Khim'bar. Their most famous members include Rukh (who killed Thrawn) and Leia's bodyguards Cakhmaim and Meewalh.",

They have tough, scaly hides ranging in color from light green to black, often with markings of another hue. Their most distinctive feature is a crest of six bony horns on their heads, which strengthen with age and can be used as weapons. They have sharp claws on their three or four-fingered hands and three-toed feet (some have a fourth backward-pointing toe). Their faces feature long, beaklike snouts full of sharp teeth, with some lower canines protruding even when their mouths are closed. Children are covered in downy feathers matching their scale color, which molt during adolescence (ages 11-15), leaving adults bald. They can produce brief flashes of light from their mouths for communication. Their eyes see only in black and white, which sometimes causes issues with color-coded technology.",
    "species_personality": "Nosaurians are naturally even-tempered but have grown bitter and resentful due to centuries of perceived marginalization by Humans. Among their own kind, they are cool-headed and congenial, but often surly with outsiders. They value clan loyalty and have strong family bonds, with males proving their worth through head-butting contests. They are proud of their culture and fiercely protective of their traditions. Offworld Nosaurians often face discrimination due to their involuntary 'sun-singing' behavior and reputation as troublemakers. Many gravitate toward thrill-seeking professions or fringe occupations when forced to leave New Plympto.",
    "species_background": "Native to New Plympto in the Core Worlds, Nosaurians first encountered Corellian traders who exploited their planet's rikknit egg trade. After unsustainable harvesting and Republic sanctions crippled their economy, they joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Following the Clone Wars, the Empire crushed their resistance, enslaved many Nosaurians, and declared their world 'expendable.' Despite rebellions led by figures like Fefar Blackeye, they remained oppressed until the Empire's fall. The Yuuzhan Vong invasion in 25 ABY devastated their world with a bioweapon, rendering it uninhabitable. Throughout history, Nosaurians have been forced into exile by economic hardship and war, with many becoming podracers, mercenaries, or slaves across the galaxy. Their society was organized into clans and city-states, with a culture deeply connected to their swampy homeworld's ecology.",

Despite having the technological capability to defend themselves against predators like the Avogwi, they refuse to use violence, instead gradually expanding their settlements to push predators away. They are generally peaceful traders and craftspeople, though small dissident groups sometimes seek outside help against their predators. Nuiwit are known to vocally question any acts of violence they witness, including the consumption of non-vegetarian food.",
    "species_background": "Native to Altor 14, the Nuiwit evolved alongside the predatory Avogwi, developing their detachable tails and 360-degree vision as defense mechanisms. Their need for protection drove the development of close-knit communities which led to advanced agriculture and civilization. By the time of their discovery by the Rego Mineral Company in 15 BBY, they had developed sophisticated agronomy, mining, and primitive droid manufacturing. They traded mineral rights to offworld corporations while maintaining their pacifist principles. Though technologically advanced enough to space travel, few Nuiwit leave their homeworld except for small dissident groups.

They have bulbous heads with a distinctive ridge along the centerline of their skulls. Their legs are short and stocky, while their necks are long and stretched. Despite their small brain size, they are capable of performing delicate technical tasks. They possess keen eyesight and acute hearing. Their skin is scaly and reptilian in nature. Life expectancy is about 65 years for those who leave their polluted homeworld, but only half that for those who remain on Sump due to the harsh environmental conditions.",
    "species_personality": "Nuknog are notoriously short-tempered and impatient, with an inability to consider long-term consequences. They focus intensely on immediate needs and desires, making them easily manipulated. They harbor deep resentment against other species, particularly blaming the Republic for their problems. Despite their volatile nature, they can enter intense states of concentration when performing technical tasks. Most Nuknog lack ambition or drive to improve their circumstances, with many willingly selling themselves into slavery just to escape their homeworld. They are suspicious of outsiders and quick to anger.",
    "species_background": "The Nuknog's tragic history began around 1,000 BBY when their leaders sold their homeworld Sump to a mining consortium in exchange for basic provisions. For centuries, they labored in dangerous mining jobs with substandard equipment, unaware they were being exploited. Jedi intervention revealed their plight to the Republic, which forced the consortium to pay reparations before dissolving. Left with a devastated, polluted world and no means of support, the Nuknog demanded perpetual aid rather than rebuilding. Republic relief efforts eventually ceased as sympathy waned. By the Clone Wars era, the Nuknog were largely forgotten, with most remaining in poverty on Sump or selling themselves into slavery offworld. Some notable Nuknog include podracer Ark 'Bumpy' Roose and detective Slyther Bushforb.",

Their most distinctive features are two sets of eyes arranged in rows (four eyes total) and a third arm extending backward from the left shoulder. Their skin is extremely wrinkled, with coloration indicating age: young adults are bright pink, mature adults chalky white, and elders progress through shades of gray. Their unusual physiology gives them unique visual capabilities and manual dexterity despite their awkward appearance. The species was nearly wiped out when their homeworld was destroyed by the Darkstaff, a Sith artifact, leaving most survivors as spiritual shadow lurkers who occasionally attempt to possess living bodies.",
    "species_personality": "Oblee are direct and honest in their dealings, having learned the dangers of deception from their near-extinction. They are slow to anger but relentless in seeking justice when wronged. Technologically curious by nature, they prefer non-Force solutions to problems and are hesitant to trust Force-users. Diplomacy is always their first approach, though they will fight if necessary. Having survived the destruction of their civilization, they value truth and perseverance above all else. Most Oblee in physical form are descendants of 'seeded' DNA across the galaxy, often unaware of their heritage like the crimelord Nirama.",
    "species_background": "The Oblee originated in the Unknown Regions before settling on Oblis, where they built an advanced technological civilization. Their society was destroyed over a thousand years ago when the Darkstaff weapon exploded, shattering their world into the Cularin asteroid belt. Most Oblee were shifted into spiritual stasis as shadow lurkers, their Force essences slowly drained by the artifact. Unknown forces seeded Oblee DNA throughout the galaxy, resulting in rare physical births like Nirama. The species was only restored through the intervention of heroes in the Cularin system. At their peak, Oblis was a wonder of technology and innovation, with its destruction representing a great loss to galactic civilization. Surviving Oblee artifacts occasionally surface in the asteroid belt remnants of their homeworld.",

Their expertise in Wild Space navigation made their information highly prized by the Corporate Sector Authority.

Their eyes are large and adapted for seeing in low-light underwater conditions, protected by a transparent nictitating membrane. Odenji have a slightly hunched posture when on land, moving with a distinctive rolling gait that becomes graceful swimming motion in water.",

They tend toward sadness or apathy in their daily lives, with a predisposition for depression when faced with traumatic events. This emotional state, called 'melanncho,' can be triggered by personal losses or failures. Despite their somber nature, Odenji form deep bonds with those they trust and can be fiercely loyal. They are thoughtful and introspective, often spending long periods contemplating their actions and the world around them. Their emotional depth makes them sensitive to others' feelings, though they rarely express this openly.",
    "species_background": "Native to the aquatic world of Issor, the Odenji evolved as amphibious beings equally at home in water and on land. Their civilization developed along coastal regions and island chains, building communities that took advantage of both environments. Odenji culture places great importance on family units and small, tight-knit communities rather than large societal structures. Their history has been marked by periods of isolation interspersed with cautious interaction with offworlders. The species' natural melancholic temperament has influenced their art, music, and storytelling traditions, which often explore themes of loss and transience.

After Tarkin's death, the Omwati developed hyperdrive technology independently and joined the New Republic, where they established their own Force tradition while some joined Luke Skywalker's Jedi Order. Their history includes both tragedy (Tarkin's brutal culling of their brightest children) and triumph (developing advanced technology despite isolation).

They produce strong pheromones used for distinguishing individuals, much like humans recognize faces. Their social structure is primitive but organized around tribal gatherings called Sahhs, each controlling vast tracts of Kidron's jungle. They are known to be practical traders, engaging in barter systems with off-worlders, particularly for Kril meat.",
    "species_background": "Native to the low-gravity world of Kidron, Orfites developed a society centered on olfactory communication. Their collective tribal structure led to the formation of the Counsel of Gordek, which partnered with off-world investors to create the Orfa Olfactory Corporation.

These tentacles secrete powerful poisons and strong adhesives to trap prey, followed by acidic secretions for digestion. Lacking eyes, they can sense light in their environment. Orgons reproduce by laying clusters of red goo on berries and plants, which cause skin irritation upon contact with human skin. Their size can reach up to 1.5 meters tall when fully extended.",

They are methodical and patient, with a timescale for decision-making that reflects their plant-based nature. Their interactions with other species are primarily driven by biological needs rather than social constructs. They are highly valued by corporations like Genetech for their unique biochemical properties, though they resist such exploitation.",

Their unique biochemistry has made them targets for corporate research, particularly by Genetech Corporation, though their natural defenses and the difficulty in maintaining them outside their native environment have prevented successful exploitation. The Orgons' existence challenges conventional definitions of intelligent life and has prompted numerous xenobiological studies.",

    "species_physical_description": "Pa'lowick were humanoid amphibians adapted to the peaceful salt marshes of their coastal habitat. Their compact, globular midsections sat atop thin, gangly legs that ended in anisodactylic feet—three toes pointing forward, one back. This configuration allowed them to swiftly navigate still waters, while powerful lungs in a strong chest helped them swim. Their slender arms ended in hands with four digits: three fingers and an opposable thumb. Pa'lowick sometimes exhibited sharp claws, other times smooth fingertips. Large, well-developed lungs and a buoyant air bladder made Pa'lowick adept swimmers; deflating the air bladder made room for the lungs to overinflate into the abdomen, permitting them to hold their breath for long periods. With their eyes at the end of short stalks, Pa'lowick could hide under water and keep watch for predators. The species had moist, smooth skin with patterns of brown, green, yellow and blue that blended with their swampy environment. Skin markings varied by individual; males sported angular shapes, females showed more rounded mottling. Their most prominent feature was a 30-centimeter, prehensile, expressive, tubular snout ending in Human-like lips. Younger Pa'lowick had two sharp, retractable tusks protruding from a second mouth at the base of this mouth-stalk. While most lost these tusks by middle age, one subspecies retained them throughout life. Average height was 1.6 meters (range 0.9-1.8m) with average weight of 48kg. Their amphibious nature made them most comfortable in moist conditions; arid environments harmed their skin, nose, and throat.",
    "species_personality": "A shy and primitive race that held their traditions dear, the Pa'lowick enjoyed offworld contact, eagerly accepting any technology that helped them better accomplish their tasks in the traditional way. Storytelling and song were integral parts of their culture, with songs written for both spirituality and enjoyment. Much of their history was passed down by song; written language arose relatively late in their development. Most members of the species lived as farmers, serving a noble class of royal families. They were generally peaceful but the tusked subspecies tended to be more aggressive due to evolutionary pressures from their more dangerous environment.",
    "species_background": "Native to the Outer Rim planet Lowick, the Pa'lowick were divided into two main subspecies sharing similar physical traits suited to their semiaquatic habitat. First contact came when Republic miners arrived searching for the system's legendary firegems. The species remained little known until Larisselle Chatrunis was crowned Miss Coruscant in 22 BBY, beginning a successful singing career. Their world remained isolated, first by an Imperial blockade, then by lack of New Republic diplomatic interest. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, invaders destroyed Lowick's farming machines though crops survived, allowing quick recovery. Notable Pa'lowick included Sy Snootles (lead singer of the Max Rebo Band) and Aneesa Dym (owner of Dusty Duck). The species was oviparous with females tending eggs until hatching. Puberty began at age 12, adulthood at 17, middle age at 45, with average lifespan of 75 years.",

    "species_physical_description": "Pantorans are Near-Human humanoids native to the moon Pantora, orbiting Orto Plutonia. They possess blue skin ranging from light to dark hues and distinctive yellow eyes. Their hair colors vary between black, blue, light purple, and occasionally white. Like Humans, they have a head, torso, and four limbs, with two sexes distinguishable by the presence of breasts in females. Their facial structure and body proportions are nearly identical to Humans, making them difficult to distinguish at a glance except for their colorful pigmentation. Pantorans share physical similarities with other blue-skinned species like the Wroonians and Chiss, though with less pronounced differences from baseline Humans than those species exhibit.",
    "species_personality": "Pantorans are known for their strong democratic traditions and civic-minded culture. They value political participation and maintain a formal governmental structure with elected officials. While generally diplomatic, their leaders can be assertive when defending Pantoran interests, as demonstrated by Chairman Chi Cho's aggressive stance during the Orto Plutonia incident. They are loyal allies when treated with respect, as shown by their continued allegiance to the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars despite economic pressures to join the Separatists. Pantoran society emphasizes collective decision-making through their Assembly system, though individual leaders can significantly influence policy during crises.",
    "species_background": "Pantorans originate from the moon Pantora in the Pantora system, where they developed a sophisticated democratic society governed by the Pantoran Assembly. During the Clone Wars, they were full members of the Galactic Republic with Senatorial representation. Their history includes a notable conflict with the Talz natives of Orto Plutonia when Chairman Chi Cho mistakenly blamed them for attacking Republic and Separatist outposts. After Cho's death in this conflict, Senator Riyo Chuchi negotiated peace, establishing Pantoran recognition of Talz sovereignty. Later, Pantora faced a Trade Federation blockade that tested their Republic loyalty, but under Baron N. Papanoida's leadership, they remained faithful allies. The species has shown resilience in maintaining their political independence while navigating galactic conflicts.",

Pau'ans exhibit patience and wisdom, traits developed through their exceptionally long lifespans (up to 700 years). They are thoughtful administrators who prefer diplomatic solutions but can be decisive when necessary. Their society values art and architecture, blending various styles in their sinkhole cities. Pau'ans are pragmatic and adaptable, having survived significant environmental changes on Utapau, yet maintain a strong sense of cultural identity and tradition.",
    "species_background": "Pau'an civilization began around 57,000 BBY, possibly as colonists from another world who adapted to Utapau's environment. Over millennia, they split into two species - the Pau'ans and Utai - with the Pau'ans retreating into Utapau's sinkholes during climate changes. They developed an industrial society powered by massive windmills while maintaining a natural aesthetic. During the Clone Wars, Utapau was occupied by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, with Pau'an leader Tion Medon secretly aiding the Republic. The planet later fell under Imperial control, with many Pau'ans enslaved. Notable Pau'ans include Darth Desolous, a fallen Jedi turned Sith Lord, and Jedi Master Lar Le'Ung. Their society represents about 30% of Utapau's population but holds most administrative positions, working cooperatively with the Utai laborers.",

Their metallic composition allows them to instantly heal superficial wounds and regenerate lost limbs, though they require extended rest to replenish their vital electroglobins after significant injury. They possess a complex circulatory system that circulates these electroglobins, enabling them to survive without oxygen. In their natural environment, they inhabit the toxic volcanic pools of Sevetta. Their bodies can alter shape and surface texture but cannot change their total mass, limiting their minimum form size to about 10cm in width while allowing limbs to slim to centimeter-width proportions.",
    "species_personality": "Polydroxols are enigmatic beings whose psychology is largely unknown to other species due to their rarity. They exhibit a tendency to travel in pairs, suggesting a social or survival-based bonding behavior. Their shapeshifting nature implies adaptability and likely a different perception of identity compared to solid-bodied species. Their ability to perfectly mimic other species' forms and languages indicates high observational skills and cognitive flexibility. The species appears to have developed strategies to compensate for their vulnerability to electroglobin loss, showing an evolutionary predisposition toward caution despite their impressive regenerative capabilities.",
    "species_background": "Native to the volcanic world of Sevetta, Polydroxols evolved as denantium-based lifeforms in toxic pools, developing remarkable shapeshifting abilities as survival mechanisms. Their unique electroglobin-based biology makes them one of the galaxy's most unusual lifeforms. Due to their rarity and specialized habitat requirements, they remain largely unknown to the wider galaxy. Their shapeshifting capabilities allow perfect mimicry of other species, making them potentially valuable (and dangerous) in interstellar society, though few venture far from their homeworld. Those that do travel often do so in pairs, possibly as a protective measure against the risks of electroglobin depletion in unfamiliar environments. Their metallic nature and regenerative abilities make them exceptionally durable, though they remain vulnerable to complete electroglobin loss which can prove fatal despite apparent physical integrity.",

They are adaptable and pragmatic, having overcome significant environmental challenges through technological innovation. Their political culture values democratic processes, with all adults participating in elections every three years. While capable of conflict (as evidenced by their pre-contact global wars), they ultimately prioritize unity when facing external opportunities or threats. Those who venture offworld often work as scouts or in space-faring professions, carrying forward their species' exploratory traditions.",
    "species_background": "The Poss'Nomin originated on the island continent Vhin on Illarreen, where climate changes forced them to develop boat-building technologies and migrate to more hospitable regions. After millennia of development and fragmentation into warring nations, first contact with spice traders prompted them to unify into a loose federation government to join the galactic community. By the Galactic Civil War era, about one-third of their population had adopted Galactic-standard technology. Many became explorers, like Kiv'arwa who worked for Rim Commercial Mining, while others like the pirate Reginald Barkbone pursued less reputable paths. Their society maintains regional governance with frequent democratic elections, focusing on galactic integration while preserving their exploratory heritage.",

Their natural form is amorphous and blob-like, capable of altering shape and coloration at will. They consume nutrients through absorption directly into their protoplasmic bodies. Their gelatinous composition allows them to mold themselves into various forms, from simple geometric shapes to complex humanoid figures. The species lacks distinct facial features or limbs in their natural state, instead forming temporary appendages as needed. Their coloration can shift to match surroundings, ranging from earthy rock tones to more vibrant hues when agitated.",
    "species_personality": "Proteans exhibit low intelligence but can understand basic commands. They typically operate in small groups of 5-10 individuals, displaying primitive social structures. Communication occurs primarily through tactile contact and chemical exchange, though they can produce simple vocalizations. Their behavior is largely instinct-driven, focused on survival and reproduction. When not hunting, they remain motionless for extended periods, often disguising themselves as rocks. They show little curiosity about technology or complex concepts, existing primarily as ambush predators in their native environment.",
    "species_background": "Native to Nathas I in the Questal sector, Proteans evolved as shape-shifting ambush predators. Their reproduction involves two individuals merging to form a stone-like cocoon that incubates for one standard year before releasing both parents and a new offspring. First contact with galactic society occurred through explorers in the Questal sector, where they became known for their deceptive hunting tactics. The species features in local legends as 'living rocks' that consume unwary travelers. Their primitive nature prevented technological development, and they remain largely confined to their homeworld. The Game Chambers of Questal documented their abilities, warning off-worlders about their smothering attacks. Not recommended as player characters due to their limited cognitive abilities and predatory instincts.",

The species faced near-extermination during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion when they attempted to resist the alien conquerors.

To avoid persecution by the Empire's Inquisitorius, Sirln fled to Tatooine where she hid in Mos Eisley for many years. She was present in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina during the events of 0 BBY when Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker chartered the Millennium Falcon.

    "species_personality": "The Qom Qae are an intelligent and strong-willed species, characterized by their keen sense of community and respect for tradition. They have a natural inclination to work together in groups, often following the proverb: 'Many vines woven together are stronger than the same number of vines separately.' While territorial as adults, they exhibit a social structure where children act as bridges between groups, gathering and sharing information. Despite being underestimated by the Chiss and former Imperial troops, Qom Qae have a sharp wit and possess the ability to communicate through telepathy and chirping, allowing them to interact with species sensitive to the Force. Their ability to build bonds, especially through life experiences and stories, is central to their culture.",
    "species_background": "The Qom Qae hail from the cliffs of Nirauan, where they live in tight-knit groups called 'nestings,' each led by a Bargainer. Their communities are highly structured, and while the adults are territorial, their young are encouraged to travel and explore. This mobility allows them to bridge gaps between different Qom Qae nestings and even between Qom Qae and their larger cousins, the Qom Jha. The Qom Qae are somewhat familiar with the larger galactic factions, having overheard Imperial communications and even stowed away on starships. Their adventurous nature and respect for balance have led them to assist key figures in galactic history, such as Mara Jade and Luke Skywalker, in their investigation of the Hand of Thrawn. Their Force sensitivity, while minor, is enough to help them communicate with certain Force-sensitive beings.",

Their brains were located in their abdomens, and their mouths were situated on their underbellies. Rakaans were efficient swimmers and hunters. The species had five phases in their life cycle, transitioning between male, female, neuter, or andro based on community needs. Male Rakaans stood about 2 meters tall, females up to 3 meters tall, and neuters about 1.5 meters.",

Their society is structured based on the needs of their species, with neuters taking on protective and hunting roles, and males and females focusing on reproduction. During periods of famine, more neuters emerge, while a decline in the population triggers more males and females to transition. Despite their tendency toward violent periods during transition phases, Rakaans are highly adaptable and maintain a close-knit, purpose-driven society.",
    "species_background": "Native to Rakaa IV, Rakaans live in warm forests and jungles. They are exceptional hunters, using their webbing skills to catch prey and spin webs for future consumption. The webs they spin are strong, but with the help of saliva mixed with nergk root juices, the webs can last for weeks. The Rakaan's life cycle includes several transitions, where they move between sexes to meet reproductive needs. These transitions are not only physical but also affect their capabilities, with different strengths and weaknesses during each phase. Due to their complex nature, Rakaans rarely leave their homeworld.",

The species developed into a highly cultured society, with few ever leaving their homeworld. Those who did, tended to be wealthy or serve the wealthy.

The nomads resisted Imperial rule, while the civilized Ranth embraced off-world culture. After the Empire's retreat, the nomads and civilized Ranth continued to battle over control of their homeworld.

Their society produces revered sages (un'Yala) who provide ethical and political guidance, with some becoming Force-sensitive. The wisdom of these sages is so valued that the Swaze of the Jidlor System make annual pilgrimages for counsel. During the Galactic Civil War, Tanlin Sha advised the Swaze, and later Moshene Tre served the New Republic.

An ovoid, clear seedcase is attached to the top of the trunk by tiny budstalks that serve as visual organs. They stand 1-2 meters tall when extended, with their leaves lifting their central trunk to about two-thirds its height. Their leaves provide senses of touch, smell, and vibration-based hearing.

Their plant-based technology includes healing salves, light sources, and even weapons like explosive Vognallian seed pods. Notable Revwiens include Wuwuhuul, a Thuwisten who joined the Rebel Alliance, and an unnamed trader on Tatooine who sold Owen Lars a swoop bike.

Their bodies are covered in soft brown fur with a flattened, bushy tail that serves as an airfoil rudder. They have large red eyes with slit pupils, pronounced brow ridges, pointed ears, and powerful mandibles with a slightly protruding lower jaw. Their wings are triangular membranes supported by elongated fingers (typically six digits per wing) with clawed tips. Their feet have grasping toes that allow them to hang upside down. Ri'Dar have extremely high metabolisms, requiring consumption of half their body weight daily in fruits, fungi, and insects. Their keen senses include exceptional long-distance vision, acute hearing, and strong smell.",
    "species_personality": "Ri'Dar are nervous, fearful creatures by nature, constantly alert for danger due to evolving alongside deadly predators. They exhibit frenetic energy and mercurial mood swings, capable of shifting rapidly between extreme emotions. Highly paranoid, they trust no one completely - not even close companions. They live entirely in the present moment with little concern for the future, focusing on immediate needs and impulses. While intelligent, their society avoids innovation and prefers ignoring problems rather than confronting them. When threatened, their first instinct is always to flee rather than fight. Despite their skittish nature, they can form attachments and sometimes display surprising loyalty to those who earn their limited trust.",
    "species_background": "Native to the low-gravity forests of Dar'Or, Ri'Dar evolved from tree-dwelling primates into flying sentients to escape predators like the sabretoothed indola. Their society developed in treetop warrens where they raised their young and practiced simple stone-age technology. The Galactic Empire's introduction of the elix bird (a deadly avian predator) further threatened their survival, forcing them to become nocturnal. Many Ri'Dar stowed away on smugglers' ships to escape their dangerous homeworld, often becoming pets or crew members. Though unable to fly in standard gravity, some found work as snipers or gamblers in the galactic underworld, leveraging their keen vision and quick reflexes. Their homeworld became an Imperial nature preserve, though this may have been a cover for other Imperial interests.",

Their snouts are flexible and help them collect and filter air, enhancing their finely-tuned olfactory senses. Rodians are primarily nocturnal, with excellent vision in the infrared spectrum, which helps them spot prey even in the dark. The species is often lean and wiry, though some Rodians may become obese if they hire others to fight for them. Their long, dexterous fingers end in suction cups, which they can use to pick up small objects. Rodians also possess a musky aroma that serves to identify individual family heritage.",
    "species_personality": "Rodians are known for their violent nature, which developed from their harsh life on Rodia's jungles. Though they are often relegated to being bounty hunters or criminals, Rodians are capable of producing successful artists, merchants, and politicians. They prize the art of hunting and their violent culture has shaped their personality, making them fiercely independent and often mistrusted by others. Their obsession with hunting and combat is rooted in their survival instincts. Rodians often exhibit aggression, though they have the capacity for loyalty and deep family ties. They possess a strong sense of personal identity, communicated through their distinct pheromone scent.",
    "species_background": "Rodian culture revolves around violence and survival, stemming from the jungle environment of their homeworld, Rodia. The species has long engaged in violent hunts, with a tradition of both internal clan warfare and gladiatorial contests. Over the centuries, their large, powerful clans consolidated control over the planet, with the title of Grand Protector being passed from clan to clan. Rodians were once a highly isolationist species but began to take on roles as mercenaries and bounty hunters in the galaxy at large. Despite their rough reputation, the Rodians have contributed to various fields such as art, commerce, and politics, and are a significant part of the galactic underworld.",

In the second stage, they become pupae, spinning cocoons around themselves. The third stage transforms them into Chroma-Wing Fliers - beautiful flying creatures with simple minds focused only on eating, flying, and mating. Larval Ruurians have six stubby legs and ten spindly arms capable of fine manipulation, with their multiple limbs allowing them to handle multiple small objects simultaneously.",
    "species_personality": "Larval-stage Ruurians are intelligent, artistic, and creative, but generally risk-averse. They have a strong sense of colony identity, remaining with their birth colony for life. As pupae, they are inactive and undergoing metamorphosis. Chroma-Wing Fliers (the adult stage) are simple-minded creatures focused only on basic instincts like eating, flying, and mating, with no interest in work or complex thought. Larval Ruurians who leave their homeworld tend to be more adventurous than average, though still cautious compared to other species.",
    "species_background": "The Ruurians' home society comprises 143 colonies on Ruuria, each with lifelong membership. Their government is the Unified Ruurian Colonies. They've established independent offworld colonies, some jointly with other species. During the Caamas Document Crisis, three colonies and Ruuria itself supported 'Grand Admiral Thrawn' (actually an impostor). Notable Ruurians include historian Skynx (who assisted Han Solo) and colony leader Amisus. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, many became refugees along the Hydian Way. Their society is primarily led by the intelligent larval stage, while the adult Chroma-Wing Fliers contribute nothing to civilization. Ruurians have participated in galactic events for centuries, with early famous individuals like Shimer Londalin winning speed competitions.",

They exhibit extreme gender antagonism, with males and females sharing a pathological hatred for each other that is only overcome by their powerful mating urges. This animosity extends even to parenting - while they temporarily cooperate to raise young, these arrangements typically end violently. Rybets are fiercely independent, with mothers unceremoniously ejecting their offspring at maturity. They are persistent in their claims about their homeworld's history with the Hutts, despite widespread skepticism. Their spacefaring lifestyle has made them adaptable but often untrustworthy.",

Notable Rybets include Moruth Doole, who administered Kessel after Endor and maintained an unusual harem. Their young mature rapidly, becoming independent by age five.

During the Galactic Empire, they reluctantly simplified protocols for dealing with Humans and Imperial-connected corporations, but reverted to strict traditions after Palpatine's death. Their wealth made them a powerful faction in the New Republic era. Though technologically advanced, they never developed space travel themselves, preferring to have the galaxy come to them for trade.

Sauvax appear bulky and threatening to humans due to their armored appearance, but are naturally peaceful.",

They rarely leave Leritor, having minimal contact with aliens, and have no known Force traditions. Sauvax communities, or 'kuuvan', live by the ocean and are led by a tevelor, who typically resides in the largest structure. They coexist with settlers from the Core Worlds, though contact is limited. They are omnivorous, consuming algae, fish, and other sea life, and are comfortable with basic technology, though they retain traditional tools and weaponry.",
    "species_background": "The Sauvax come from Leritor, a little-known oceanic world not often visited by outsiders. During the New Sith Empire, Sith forces attempted to exploit the planet and left behind ancient relics. In 30 BBY, a Sith adept incited conflict between Sauvax and settlers to distract them from her excavation, using Sauvax prisoners as underwater miners. The situation was eventually resolved when offworlders defeated her, restoring peace. Sauvax settlements are primitive but resourceful, built from stone, sand, and wreckage, often near tidal zones.

Their bodies are covered in sleek yellow, brown, or gray fur, and they possess two arms with webbed fingers, hip fins for stabilization, and merged legs forming a tail fluke. Unique to aquatic mammals, Sedrians have both gills and lungs, allowing them to function underwater and on land. Their prominent whiskers are highly sensitive, capable of detecting movement and changes in electric fields in aquatic environments.",
    "species_personality": "Sedrians are deeply spiritual beings who center their society around the worship of the Golden Sun—a communal, Force-sensitive intelligence they do not realize is alive. They are not naturally aggressive, but become agitated, unpredictable, and sometimes violent when separated from the influence of Golden Sun. This emotional dependence makes them unsuitable for extended offworld activity, although some rare individuals have adapted, typically through generational separation.",
    "species_background": "Native to the oceans of Sedri, Sedrians developed an early industrial society powered entirely by the Golden Sun. The capital city, Fitsay, is home to the dome that houses the Golden Sun, which provides energy for all technology and even serves as a healer via the Force. The High Priest governs Sedrian society, unaware that the Golden Sun is a sentient entity. Sedrians rarely leave their planet due to emotional and spiritual dependence on Golden Sun. However, after assistance from the Rebel Alliance against an Imperial garrison, they became supporters of the Alliance and later the New Republic. Their contributions include representation on the New Republic Provisional Council and production of Amphibion assault vessels used in the Battle of Mon Calamari.",

Selkath tend to be reserved, preferring calm and measured discourse, but they can be fiercely protective of their cultural heritage. They are generally not inclined to violence, though they can be pushed into extreme actions when necessary, as demonstrated during the Jedi Civil War and the rise of the Galactic Empire.

Their influence in galactic politics peaked during the Jedi Civil War when they leveraged their control over kolto to maintain a position of neutrality. However, over time, as the demand for kolto diminished and the galaxy's focus shifted, the Selkath found themselves increasingly isolated. Despite their historical neutrality, some Selkath secretly supported the Republic, dealing with them to mine extra kolto from the Hrakert Rift. This led to a tragedy when the Progenitor, a giant firaxan shark, drove many of them to madness, prompting violence. During the rise of the Galactic Empire, Manaan was conquered, and the Selkath were enslaved, forced to live in floating villages around Ahto City. The Empire exploited the planet's resources, and the Selkath were subjugated until their eventual revolt, sparked by Darth Vader's manipulation of the Order of Shasa.

Despite being physically weaker than other species, Shashay can still be formidable in combat, using their talons and beaks.",
    "species_personality": "Shashay are known for their strong community loyalty and fiery tempers. While they are inherently peaceful, they can become fiercely protective of their own and can display a high level of territoriality, particularly in relation to their homeworld. The Shashay are deeply artistic, renowned for their singing abilities and their understanding of three-dimensional space, which makes them exceptional astrogators. They have a deep-seated mistrust of outsiders, especially those from the Galactic Empire, due to their efforts to protect their homeworld. Despite their reluctance to leave Crytal Nest, Shashay are passionate and brave when it comes to protecting their people and culture.",
    "species_background": "The Shashay are a secretive species native to Crytal Nest, known for their intricate vocal cords and exceptional astrogation skills. They were determined to keep the coordinates of their homeworld hidden from the Empire and would not share this information with navigation computers, relying solely on their own memories for navigation. This refusal to share their world’s location led to a tense relationship with the Empire, though some Shashay did work with the Rebel Alliance. Shashay are governed by the Nestmothers, a council of leaders who were initially opposed to involving their people in galactic politics but later allowed select Shashay to assist the Alliance. The species also has a strong cultural tradition of music, with their songs considered uniquely beautiful, and they are known to produce the alcoholic drink Idlewil. The Shashay do not easily share their secrets, and will die rather than reveal the location of Crytal Nest.",

The species is conservative, and most Shawda Ubb prefer to live and die in their local villages. However, emigration, while rare, has occurred, and some Shawda Ubb, such as Rappertunie, have ventured off-world to pursue careers.

They have four pairs of red eyes, each adapted to see different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including ultraviolet and infrared. The head features a pair of mandibles used to inject venom, which paralyzes and intoxicates prey. They possess eight legs and a short, fat abdomen with four spinnerets that produce fine webs. Sic-Six communicate in a high-pitched voice and often infuse their speech with screeches. They have highly sensitive hearing, with their whole bodies acting as tympanic membranes. This makes them susceptible to loud noises, which can injure or kill them.",
    "species_personality": "Sic-Six are solitary by nature and uncomfortable around their own kind, only coming together to mate. They are highly insecure and prefer to control their environment. They are also sensitive to sound and often use webs to detect intruders. Though they are excellent at producing technology, they lack the social cohesion to establish assembly lines. They value the humanities and are often scholars. Sic-Six society is decentralized, as they dislike central authority and prefer to maintain control over their individual surroundings.",
    "species_background": "Originating from the planet Sisk, the Sic-Six are a species of intelligent arachnids with a highly developed sense of hearing, vision, and the ability to produce webbing. They are solitary beings that value privacy and control. Their native environment has undergone rapid climatic changes, speeding up their evolutionary process. Despite their solitary nature, Sic-Six have a reputation for producing fine art and have become wealthy from their venom, which is used as a powerful stimulant. Many Sic-Six are abducted by criminals who seek to exploit their poison-producing abilities.",

    "species_background": "The Sludir originated as a primitive tribal society on Sluudren, evolving into a sophisticated caste-based feudal system with warriors at the top, followed by artisans and workers. They never developed advanced technology but mastered stonemasonry, creating massive fortresses and monuments. Their legal system was based on trials by combat, and rank could be gained by defeating superiors. The Galactic Empire conquered Sluudren and enslaved the Sludir, though some escaped and joined the Rebel Alliance seeking vengeance. After the Empire's fall, Sludir regained control of their homeworld, though it became dominated by those who found success in the criminal underworld. Many returning slaves were dismayed by their homeworld's condition and left again.",

Their bodies are covered in fine scales ranging from light brown to dark green, with rare color variations. They have round black eyes, a hoodlike fold of tough skin at the back of their heads, and forked tongues that aid their heat sensing and smell. The average Sluissi stands 1.5-1.8 meters tall and weighs about 60 kilograms.",
    "species_personality": "Sluissi are renowned for their calm, patient, and relaxed temperament. They are sociable, easy-going beings who remain composed under pressure. Their inability to become genuinely upset or angry often baffles or frustrates other species. Extremely methodical and industrious, they love tinkering with mechanical objects and approach starship construction as an art form. They strictly adhere to protocols, no matter how trivial, and have an aversion to rushing or impatience. Their speech in Basic often includes slurs and lisps due to their snakelike mouth structures.",

Their technology was nearly on par with other spacefaring races when they joined the Old Republic early in its history. They established major space yards throughout the Sluis sector, becoming renowned for starship maintenance. Before the Clone Wars, they became disillusioned with the Republic and were among the first to join the Separatists. After Imperial occupation, they became valuable New Republic members. In 9 ABY, the Empire attacked Sluis Van shipyards, leading to the Battle of Sluis Van where Han Solo and the Millennium Falcon aided the Sluissi. Notable Sluissi include Ten Dorne (B-wing developer), Sere Lure (Imperial engineer), and Candobar Inglet (Sluis Sector ruler during Clone Wars).

Sneevels have wide mouths with protruding bottom canines and smaller upper teeth, with pink tongues. Some decorate their jaw hair with jewelry. They exude a strong odor that varies with their mood, used for communication. Their small bodies are exceptionally nimble with high reflexes, granting them excellent reaction time and combat dodging ability. The average lifespan is 76 standard years.",
    "species_personality": "Sneevels are notorious thrill-seekers with a compulsive need for adventure and danger. They are generally surly and antisocial, closer in temperament to Dashades than most species. Their daredevil nature leads them to pursue high-risk occupations and activities, often with little regard for personal safety. While some are motivated by noble causes, most seek personal excitement above all else. They communicate partially through 'mood musks' - odoriferous scents that indicate emotional states. Non-Sneevels typically find their scent overpowering and unpleasant. Despite their generally unpleasant demeanor, some Sneevels like Boles Roor have achieved social success in creative fields.",
    "species_background": "Native to the Mid Rim planet Sneeve, Sneevels developed a technological society in isolation, pioneering dangerous sublight space travel using shoddy rocket-boosted submersibles. Discovered by Duros explorers who provided hyperdrive technology, they joined the Old Republic but showed little interest in politics. During the Clone Wars era, Senator Jollin Resbin represented the Kastolar Sector and supported the Military Creation Act. The Galactic Empire attempted to confine Sneevels to their homeworld, driving many to join the Rebel Alliance more for the thrill of rebellion than political ideals. Notable Sneevels include podracer/glimmik singer Boles Roor and Senator Resbin. Their reckless nature led many to die in avoidable circumstances, though some Rebel Sneevels became martyrs for the cause.",

Despite their tough exterior, Snivvians are known for their artistic sensibilities developed during long winters spent in subterranean caverns.",
    "species_personality": "Snivvians are renowned artists and authors with deep artistic sensibilities cultivated through generations of winter hibernation. However, they also have a reputation for sociopathic tendencies similar to Trandoshans. They are highly distrustful of twins due to genetic issues in their own species (the 'Blood Code'), where twin males often display psychotic genius traits. Many Snivvians travel the galaxy seeking experiences to fuel their art, even when dangerous. They typically speak Basic plus multiple secondary languages, though some retain their native tongue for symbolic reasons. Their artistic nature coexists with a cultural memory of hardship and slavery that makes them resilient but wary.",
    "species_background": "Snivvians endured numerous hardships that shaped their culture, including brutal enslavement by Thalassians before being protected by the Galactic Republic. Their homeworld's extreme cold forced long periods of underground living, during which they developed remarkable artistic talents across multiple mediums - holography, painting, sculpture, music, and literature. While technology reduced the need for hibernation, they maintain the tradition biologically and culturally. The species has struggled with genetic issues (the Blood Code) causing violence and distrust of twins. Notable Snivvians include Zutton (seen in Mos Eisley Cantina) and Olsini Turpo (a tailor on Lamaredd).

They have five-fingered hands with hard fingernails. Their faces are framed by thick, coarse yellow hairs growing from the chin and jowls, with broad mouths featuring thick lips beneath small flat noses. Their yellow eyes (with yellow or red irises) are set deep within bony brows, sometimes with black eyebrows. A narrow crest runs along the top of their skull from behind the eyes to the back of the head. They have floppy ears fringed with bristly hairs on both sides of the head. Squalris typically dress in ostentatious, luxurious clothing adorned with elaborate embroidery and gemstones to display their wealth and status.",
    "species_personality": "Squalris are gregarious, charismatic beings with a natural gift for negotiation and deal-making. They are unrepentant capitalists who love to haggle and are driven by the pursuit of fortune and social standing. Generally non-violent and easy-going, they can become fiercely protective of their business interests. Their entire psychology revolves around acquiring success, money, property, and status. They are known throughout the Perlemian Trade Route as shrewd businessbeings, with the phrase 'slick as a Squalris' becoming common parlance for skilled dealmakers. While sociable and charming, they can be single-minded in their pursuit of profit and social advancement.",
    "species_background": "Native to the planet Ifmix VI in the Colonies region, Squalris joined the galactic community early in the Galactic Republic's history. Their homeworld's location along the Perlemian Trade Route allowed Squalris merchants to spread throughout the galaxy. Their society developed under Ifmix VI's harsh weather conditions of constant turbulent winds and tornadoes. Notable Squalris include merchant Sanglui who operated an import-export business on Vorzyd V while secretly aiding the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. The species' language has both spoken and written forms, though most learn Basic as well. Squalris names are often single-part (like Feemus or Klabelon) though some have two parts (like Zlorr Uluj). Their lifespan averages 90 standard years, reaching adolescence at 11, maturity at 19, and middle age at 55.",

Their skin was pink and covered in colorful fur—white, gray, black, brown, blue, violet, or red—which served as an olfactory organ. They could identify scents, detect forgeries, and even see through disguises using their fur. This ability led to a traditional Squib greeting: rubbing another's palm across their cheek fur. They had large eyes set on the sides of their heads in shades of blue, yellow, red, or brown, tufted ears that pivoted to capture sound, and sharp teeth in a short, tapered muzzle. Squibs also had flexible cheeks to store objects, five-fingered hands, and five-toed feet. Their hackles raised when nervous, and they often wore clothing that left fur exposed for scent-based communication.",
    "species_personality": "Squibs were cheerful, friendly, and overconfident—often to the point of egotism. Their gregariousness made them likable at first, but some found them annoying over time. Curious to a fault, Squibs had a compulsive need to touch and 'taste' interesting objects by rubbing them against their fur. They were notorious for being pack rats, carrying odd trinkets in their clothing, which typically included pouches and pockets. Bluffing and blustering were preferred responses to threats, especially when not in direct view. Although usually non-threatening, their sharp teeth could be used for intimidation. Squibs often displayed a charming yet insistent attitude, leading to mixed reputations across the galaxy.",
    "species_background": "Hailing from Skor II, Squibs were sentient beings known for their obsession with bargaining, trade, and deal-making. They often engaged in bartering for information and goods. Squibs had a reputation for resourcefulness and were sometimes viewed as thieves due to their scavenging habits. They lived fast-paced lives with quick metabolisms and relatively short lifespans: fuzzlings until age 9, sexually mature at 13, middle-aged by 39, and life expectancy of around 65 standard years. Their society embraced curiosity and communication through scent and texture, with greetings and trust often hinging on touch. Despite their eccentricities, Squibs played active roles in galactic trade and politics, although not always favorably regarded.",

While tolerant of heat, they are vulnerable to cold and often wear warm clothing in colder climates. Their pelage cannot retain warmth effectively. They can sometimes develop ventriloquism skills, projecting grunts to confuse prey.",
    "species_personality": "Srrors'toks are deeply honorable and loyal, with an unsparing concept of honor. They are incapable of betraying friends or kin and feel obligated to help them in any situation. A central cultural element is the life-debt—if a Srrors'tok's life is saved, they are bound to serve the savior until death. Failure to fulfill this bond is a disgrace. They are also communal, bonding through activities like hunting, and often live in blood-related tribes. Though non-technological by default, some adapt to using advanced weapons like blasters.",
    "species_background": "Native to Jankok, Srrors'toks have a mostly primitive society, with some individuals like Tyionsis Cex and Ahnjai Rahmma joining galactic factions like the Empire. Their society has largely resisted technological evolution. They communicate using Hras'kkk'rarr—a complex language of growls, grunts, and clicks, supported by gestures and body language.

    "species_physical_description": "The Ssi-ruuk are large bipedal saurian creatures with avian traits, standing 1.9 to 2.2 meters tall and weighing around 350 kg. They have powerful hind legs, a muscular tail for balance, and upper limbs ending in three prehensile claws. Their thick, scaled skin ranges from brown to turquoise and can withstand blaster shots with only minor burns. They possess long beak-like muzzles filled with sharp teeth and triple eyelids to protect their light-sensitive eyes. Their most distinctive features are two black, forked 'scent tongues' that emerge from their nostrils, giving them an acute sense of smell. They are warm-blooded despite their reptilian appearance and move with surprising grace for their size. Their strong, acrid reptilian odor is noticeable to other species.",
    "species_personality": "Ssi-ruuk are deeply xenophobic and view themselves as superior to all other species, whom they consider fit only for slavery or entechment. Their rigid caste system based on skin color dictates social standing, creating a highly compartmentalized society. They are intensely religious, fearing death on unconsecrated worlds, which limits their travel outside their star cluster. Their acute sense of smell allows them to detect emotional states and deception in others, making them difficult to lie to. They find the scent of other species distasteful and communicate through complex musical tweets and whistles that most humanoids cannot reproduce.",
    "species_background": "The Ssi-ruuk originate from the Ssi-ruuk Star Cluster in the Unknown Regions, with their capital on Lwhekk. They established the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium, governed by the Shreeftut with advisory councils (the religious Conclave and political Elders' Council). Their society revolves around entechment technology that harvests life energies from sentient beings to power machines. They initiated the Battle of Bakura in 4 ABY shortly after Endor, marking one of their few major incursions into known space. Their religious beliefs prevent extensive travel, as they fear dying on unconsecrated worlds would doom their spirits to eternal wandering. Their language consists of complex bird-like sounds largely inaudible to humans, earning them the nickname 'Fluties.' They maintain a rigid caste system and rely on P'w'eck servants and battle droids for menial tasks and warfare.",

In the aftermath of the Battle of Yavin, the Stenax massacred Imperials and non-Stenaxes, leading to a brutal campaign called the Stenax Massacres.

Their heads feature large eyes, wide projecting snouts, and upright equine ears that twitch when stressed. Their bodies are covered in short, coarse fur except for their snouts, eyes, hooves, and ears. Each Svivreni has a distinctive mane of orange or copper hair growing from their head, which they typically wear in long braids or ponytails that can reach below the waist. Their hands have four triple-jointed fingers, and they move on cloven hooves. Despite their small size, they possess strength comparable to larger humanoid species.",

They value elaborate social rituals, especially in greetings and farewells (never using the word 'goodbye'). They have a strong sense of justice and community, having maintained strict laws on their homeworld that included capital punishment for serious crimes. Their stubborn nature makes them resistant to coercion or conquest, as demonstrated by their resistance to Imperial occupation. They mature slightly faster than humans but enjoy much longer lifespans, often working well into their 90s.",

They were members of the Galactic Republic with a weapon-free society that became an important trade hub. They remained neutral during the Clone Wars and Galactic Civil War, though they fiercely resisted Imperial occupation under Grand Admiral Thrawn. Notable Svivreni include miners Saqc'or and Kitalic Nirasik, crime lord Torsteen, and political figures Tyro and Curran Caladian. The species later aligned with the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances and the Galactic Alliance Remnant. Their society produced both respected miners and political operatives, showing their adaptability despite their generally isolationist tendencies.",

The beings had long, thick tails that ended in knobby spikes, although not all members of the species exhibited this trait. Their glistening, hairless loose-hanging skin ranged in color from sallow gray to ashen off-white, and their soft tissue was thick and rubbery. The Swokes Swokes visage featured two large, lidless eyes that ranged from black to red or blue, hidden behind goggle-like natural shades. A gaping grin of irregular, fang-like teeth and one to three nostrils lie beneath. The bulbous head, situated atop the fleshy neck, was ringed by a series of sharp horns, and another set of horns at the top. The overall effect was that of a creature common to the nightmares of many cultures.",
    "species_personality": "Swokes Swokes were fierce and resilient creatures, known for their remarkable regenerative abilities and resistance to pain. They were culturally obsessed with death, viewing it as a natural and essential aspect of life. Despite their fierce exterior, they had a strong sense of status, with jewelry being a prominent symbol of rank. They did not embrace advanced technology but instead preferred simple, yet effective tools. Due to their battle-hardened nature and ability to regrow lost limbs, they were relentless opponents. Swokes Swokes respected strength, both physical and mental, and they held traditions that often involved combat or challenges to prove worth.",
    "species_background": "The Swokes Swokes were native to Makem Te, an Outer Rim world with little advanced technology. They were ruled by a coalition of royal families known as the Congress of Caliphs. Their society valued combat and endurance, with a strong emphasis on regrowing lost limbs and surviving in harsh environments. As a result of their regeneration abilities and high pain tolerance, they were considered formidable opponents in battle. The Swokes Swokes never joined the New Republic but instead participated in several galactic conflicts. Their society was disrupted by the introduction of galactic technology, leading to political unrest and the rise of various religious sects. Despite this, they maintained their ancient traditions, resisting much of the external influences and changes brought about by galactic wars.",

In trade interactions, they are direct but follow complex bartering practices similar to the Killiks, sometimes taking months or years to complete negotiations.

Their knowledge of terrain and use of tantas aids them in salvage disputes. At the time of the Rise of the Empire, they apparently spoke only Basic but used a complex system of hand signals and noises called 'Talid signaling.'

They have elongated limbs and slender builds, giving them an overall wiry appearance. Their facial features are sharp and angular, with high cheekbones and pronounced brow ridges. Both racial variants share the same basic physiology, differing primarily in skin pigmentation. The purple-skinned Tammuz-an of the Kingdom tend to have more refined features associated with their noble class, while the blue-skinned Outer Territories Tammuz-an often have more weathered appearances from their harder lifestyles.",
    "species_personality": "Tammuz-an society is deeply divided along racial lines between the purple-skinned ruling class and blue-skinned outer territories inhabitants. The purple Tammuz-an maintain a hereditary monarchy with strict ceremonial traditions, valuing protocol and formal hierarchy. They can be somewhat aristocratic in demeanor. The blue Tammuz-an are more independent and skeptical of central authority. Both groups share a strong sense of planetary identity when faced with external threats. The species as a whole is capable of overcoming internal divisions when presented with a common enemy, as shown when they united against the pirate Gir Kybo Ren-Cha. Romantic relationships between the two groups, such as that between Mon Julpa and Princess Gerin, were historically rare but became symbols of unity.",
    "species_background": "The Tammuz-an civilization is centered around a hereditary monarchy where the rightful king must present the royal scepter to the Keeper of the Tower at the first sun of the equinox to be officially crowned. During the early Imperial era, the planet was nearly taken over by the scheming vizier Zatec-Cha, who mind-wiped Crown Prince Mon Julpa and left him stranded on Tyne's Horky. With help from loyalists and offworld allies including Humans and droids, Mon Julpa regained his throne. His subsequent marriage to Princess Gerin of the Outer Territories helped unite the planet's two feuding races. This unity was further strengthened when they worked together to rescue Gerin from the pirate Gir Kybo Ren-Cha. The Tammuz-an have maintained their distinct racial identities while developing stronger planetary unity in the face of external threats.",

During the Galactic Civil War, the species was divided in allegiance, with members serving both the Empire and Rebel Alliance. They developed their own starship technology including the Taloron Prey Chaser.

Their society is communal and highly cooperative, placing significant value on sharing and redistribution. The Talz do not understand or value ownership, instead borrowing what is needed and giving away surplus freely. This trait often leads outsiders to mistakenly label them as thieves. Their motivations tend to center around the collective good rather than personal ambition, and few things enrage a Talz more than the enslavement or mistreatment of their kind.",
    "species_background": "The Talz are native to Alzoc III, a remote, mineral-rich ice planet. They also maintain a colony on Orto Plutonia. By the time the Galactic Empire discovered them, the Talz were considered primitive, having only recently developed sentience. They build basic shelters for protection and demonstrate some understanding of advanced technologies, such as recognizing the effects of blasters and speeders. Their culture revolves around clans and extended families with complex social norms governing resource distribution. The Talz have a deeply ingrained sense of communal responsibility and resilience born from surviving their harsh environment.

They were covered in translucent scales that revealed the skin’s color-changing properties beneath, aiding both communication and camouflage. Their signature feature was a colorful fan of flesh and scales called a kampo, which flared open around their heads in moments of strong emotional distress—an involuntary trait that could make concealment of discomfort difficult during tense encounters. The scales also repelled heat naturally. Their coloration changed based on mood or activity; brown when calm and in comfort, red when excited or after prolonged activity. Tarasins also had short tails and short spines on their forearms called sa'tosin, which enabled them to sense Force usage nearby.",
    "species_personality": "Tarasins were naturally curious, protective of their people, and slow to anger. While not especially strong physically, they were known for their intellectual capabilities. Their society placed great importance on clan and spiritual leadership, with the eldest female revered as 'Mother' and seen as an ideal to aspire toward. Tarasin social structures leaned on practicality rather than hierarchy, and leadership roles were taken based on availability and necessity, not dominance or prestige. Their peaceful temperament allowed for long-term societal cohesion, even in the densest jungle underbrush of Cularin.",
    "species_background": "Originally nomadic, the Tarasins eventually developed into a settled tribal society grouped into clans called irstat. Each irstat typically consisted of several dozen individuals, though some like the Hiironi clan had up to 300 members. Their villages, made primarily of wood and sometimes prefabricated buildings, blended into the jungle and appeared easily movable, though they were not generally nomadic. Some Tarasin also lived in minority populations in the cities of Gadrin and Hedrett. The first two irstat met at a central landmark stone in the Sacred ch'hala tree grove, symbolizing their shared origins and mutual support—each group settled a day's walk from the stone, allowing separation and aid. While not used for worship, the grove was sacred for celebrating life. Outsiders were strictly prohibited from entering. Leadership was matriarchal for pragmatic reasons; the second oldest female served as the Irstat-Kes (chief), as males often ventured for food and supplies.",

Standing around two meters tall, they possessed an exo-skeletal musculature that made them appear large and intimidating. They were bipeds with two legs and four arms—the upper arms were dexterous, while the lower arms ended in powerful pincers used for combat. Tarc had no lips, teeth, or tongues. Instead, they had hollow spikes in their mouths which injected acidic saliva into their prey. These spikes shredded food, initiating a two-stage digestion process starting in the mouth. Their primary diet consisted of desert creatures like sand mollusks. Their vocalizations, formed by clicks and grunts via mouth spikes, made communication with other species very difficult.",
    "species_personality": "Though not innately violent, Tarc were fiercely isolationist and upheld a strict zero-tolerance policy toward outsiders, bordering on xenophobia. They were known to be intense and emotional, with pent-up aggression capable of erupting into uncontrollable berserker rages, particularly under stress. These frenzies could not be calmed and would typically result in indiscriminate violence. Tarc who left their home system without permission were considered criminals, reinforcing their culture’s emphasis on order and containment.",
    "species_background": "Native to Hjaff, the Tarc remained largely confined to their home system despite limited space colonization. Their language—comprised of clicks, clacks, growls, and grunts—is incompatible with Galactic Basic and most other common tongues, making them nearly incomprehensible even to protocol droids. Due to this and their self-imposed isolation, the Tarc are a rare sight in galactic society. Those found outside Hjaff are usually banished individuals who face immense difficulty integrating due to cultural and linguistic barriers.",

They possess two wings with a 10-20 meter wingspan, four legs, and long tails ending in fan-shaped fins. Their front legs feature three-clawed feet that function as nimble hands, while stronger rear feet are used for perching or grasping prey. Their bodies are covered in thick, warty skin ranging from olive green to reddish tan to brown, darkening with age, with tufts of feathers on the undersides of their leathery wings. Their heads are dominated by large hooked beaks and dark yellow eyes with exceptional vision extending into infrared spectrum. Tarongs have acute hearing but almost no sense of smell. They are physically adapted for flight, capable of speeds up to 40 kilometers per hour.",
    "species_personality": "Tarongs are naturally talkative, friendly, and highly social creatures. They possess an innate talent for mimicry, quickly picking up languages and imitating voices. Conversation and storytelling are central to their culture, forming the basis of their courtship rituals and informal governance. Despite being large carnivores, they are fundamentally non-violent, greeting strangers as friends and only resorting to defensive actions when threatened. They have a playful sense of humor, often amused by clothing customs of other species. Tarongs are curious about the galaxy and enthusiastic about space travel, gems, and especially protocol droids, which they treat as honored family members. They value companionship and will often talk to their prey before eating it, refusing to consume anything that can talk back.",
    "species_background": "Native to the twin worlds of Iri and Disim in the Epidimi System, Tarongs evolved from prehistoric flying reptiles. The two populations were nearly identical when discovered by the Galactic Republic around 5,000 BBY, suggesting one world was colonized from the other in ancient times. They live in canopy huts in tropical forests, organized into small tribes led informally by the most experienced storytellers. After galactic contact, many Tarongs became explorers, though their society remained largely unchanged except for adopting droids and space technology. During the Imperial era, they disliked the Empire's unfriendly nature and some secretly aided the Rebel Alliance, serving as excellent spies due to their flight and mimicry abilities. Their worlds became trading centers where they exchanged minerals for jewelry and droids, though they maintained their traditional semi-anarchic society centered around seasonal storytelling gatherings.",

Their seven-fingered hands had long curved claws, which they could use along with their sharp teeth in hand-to-hand combat. Many non-Tarro found their strength and natural weapons to be intimidating. Their faces were distinguished by their large foreheads and flat noses.",
    "species_personality": "Tarro are fiercely independent by nature and individualistic in philosophy. Most prefer to work alone and quickly lose patience with others—even fellow Tarro. Some suppress these tendencies to work in groups, but they express dissatisfaction when things go wrong. Their independent outlook led many Tarro to support the Rebellion against the Empire. Tarro often became bounty hunters, mercenaries, scouts, or criminal enforcers, leading a transient lifestyle in less regulated galactic regions.",
    "species_background": "Though they had an advanced technological civilization, the Tarro had few ties with the rest of the galaxy. This changed when their sun, Til, suddenly exploded around 100 BBY. The cause remained unknown during the Imperial era, though rumors spoke of an experimental superweapon. Only off-world Tarro survived—fewer than five hundred. These refugees scattered across the Unknown Regions and Outer Rim. Their descendants numbered about 350 by the time of the Galactic Civil War. Elders attempted to preserve their culture and language, but their efforts were often hampered by the independent Tarro mindset. The largest known group lived in Somin City on Seltos. A few Tarro continued to search for lost colonies.",

After the planet's water fully evaporated, the Temolak became expert scavengers, searching the galaxy for derelict ships and space stations. They developed advanced technologies, such as orbital ships and hyperdrive, allowing them to expand their operations. During the rise of the Empire, many Temolak left the Temolak Salvage Consortium and sought their fortunes in the Outer Rim. The Temolak often operated independently, creating a network of salvage crews and colonies in space.

Some Theelin individuals, like Rystáll Sant and Diva Arroquitas, possessed small horns on the sides of their heads. Others, like Diva Shaliqua and Darth Phobos, had hooved feet. Hands may vary, with some exhibiting three fingers like Shug Ninx, while others have five like typical Humans.",

They are expressive, creative, and many have an innate affinity for the arts. Their society historically placed a high value on these talents, with artistic expression serving as both identity and legacy. Due to their rarity, some Theelin were commodified or even enslaved, as in the case of Hutt Ingoda who collected Theelin and part-Theelin performers. Female Theelin were often named 'Diva' in the hope they would develop vocal talents and uphold the legacy of the Diva order.",
    "species_background": "Tragically, the Theelin species was plagued by a series of mutations near the end of the Galactic Republic era. These genetic anomalies made intra-species reproduction impossible, and even cross-breeding with Humans or Near-Humans was largely unsuccessful due to high infant mortality. The species entered a steep decline, and by 10 ABY, pure Theelin were presumed extinct. Despite their dwindling numbers, the Theelin left behind a legacy of unmatched artistic achievements, particularly in the final years before the Republic’s fall. The Theelin Divas were especially famous, considered the greatest singers in the galaxy by many scholars.",

They have four arms, with the upper set being stronger and larger in upper-class individuals. Each hand has five fingers tipped with sturdy claws. Their bodies are covered in scales, with long hair surrounding their heads that often matches their scale color. They shed their skin periodically through grooming with oils and salves. When at rest, they coil their tails beneath them, reducing their height by half a meter. Upper-class Thisspiasians typically conceal their lower arms with garments.",
    "species_personality": "Thisspiasians have a complex social hierarchy with distinct upper and working classes. Upper-class individuals consider it unsophisticated to display their lower arms in public, while working-class members show no such aversion. They require only two hours of sleep but must meditate for 5-6 hours daily; without proper meditation, they become prone to emotional outbursts. Thisspiasians value discipline and control, particularly among their upper classes. They maintain sophisticated customs around public appearance and behavior.",
    "species_background": "Native to the planet Thisspias, this reptilian species evolved with unique adaptations like their prehensile tails and four arms. Their beards developed as protection against biting cygnats. While omnivorous, they prefer live food like insects, birds, and rodents, which they can consume whole by unhinging their jaws. The species shows signs of continuing evolution, with upper-class members developing weaker lower arms compared to working-class individuals. Thisspiasians have appeared in galactic affairs, including during the events surrounding the Phantom Menace.",

Their mouths are filled with short, sharp teeth, and their large pink tongues are constantly moving. Their large, black eyes appear glassy due to a protective clear film covering them. Many have prominent sickle-shaped claws on their feet, and some display a crest of feathers atop their heads. There are six subspecies distinguished by scale markings: sil-ar (diamond patterns), kal-ar (concentric bands), ask-ar (red facial masks), orl-ar (green with yellow-orange stripes), nil-ar (thin red bands around eyes and limbs), and isk-ar (albino with translucent white scales).",

They approach problems with detached calculation, preferring subterfuge over direct confrontation. Most conduct business legitimately with a strong appreciation for the art of the deal, though their cutthroat business practices sometimes involve assassination.

The planet is governed by the Tiss'sharl League, composed of the most profitable business leaders, where political advancement often comes through assassination. Their language consists of hisses and shrieks with a written form of sharp lines and curves. Tiss'shar typically wear minimal clothing, often just tool harnesses, though League members and guards wear elaborate outfits. Their cuisine reflects their predatory nature, serving unheated meat still attached to bone or whole small animals.

Their formidable physical build includes sharp teeth and claws, which enhance their combat prowess.",

Their society demonstrates a deep cultural rift between the sexes—males are proud nomads devoted to physical contest and the wild, while females prefer community life and technological development. Despite these differences, Togorians are monogamous and deeply committed to their chosen mates. Though they can understand Basic, they rarely speak it, which often leads to others underestimating their intelligence—something they find infuriating.",
    "species_background": "Native to Togoria, Togorians evolved as hunters of native creatures like the Bist and Etelo, while themselves being preyed upon by liphons. Over time, they formed symbiotic relationships with the smaller flying reptiles known as mosgoths, which they domesticated as mounts. This dynamic led to a unique societal structure: males remained nomadic and lived in the wilderness, while females formed permanent cities where they raised children and advanced their civilization. Despite living apart, both sexes remain culturally intertwined. They have historically aligned with the Mandalorians and are feared across the galaxy due to their fearsome reputation.",

While they can communicate complex emotional states to each other visually, they struggle with interstellar interactions and are often exploited by offworlders.

    "species_physical_description": "The Troigs were a distinctive two-headed species from Pollillus, with two heads and four arms. Each Troig had one primary hand with three off hands. Because the two sets of arms were controlled independently by each head, they lacked good coordination. While most Troigs were born with a pair of heads (each with its own mind), those with three or more heads were rare and celebrated in Troig culture. Each head was known respectively as the Saprin (right head) and the Saprah (left head). The Saprin was the source of 'breath humors': loyalty, faith, and cunning, while the Saprah governed 'blood humors': love, anger, and passion. Each head was constantly aware of the other, with their names joined by the conjunction 'sin' (e.g., 'Fode' and 'Beed' becomes 'Fodesinbeed'). Each head was capable of independent thought and speech, making them two individuals sharing one body. They were discovered by the wider galaxy shortly before the Invasion of Naboo. Notable Troigs included podracer commentator Fodesinbeed and talk show host AndroosinLiann.",
    "species_personality": "Troigs were sentient bipeds characterized by their multiple heads (typically two, though rare specimens had three or more). Each head was a unique individual with distinct personality, memories, will, and skills, yet connected through a neural system that provided limited telepathic ability. This connection allowed instantaneous warnings between heads and enabled language sharing - if one head learned a language, the other could understand it. Unconsciousness in one head didn't necessarily affect the other, though banging heads together could induce dual unconsciousness. Death of one head usually meant death for both without advanced medical intervention. Physically, Troigs had conical craniums with some sporting short horns, variable hair (from bristles to topknots), and narrow faces with slit-pupiled eyes that provided excellent peripheral vision. Their four arms (two forward, two rear) had limited coordination, with only one fully dexterous hand per pair of arms. Skin colors varied dramatically (cream, brown, green, etc.), often differing between heads on the same body.",
    "species_background": "After first contact with the Galactic Republic, many Troigs left their planet, becoming common enough on Coruscant by the Clone Wars that Dexter Jettster's diner imposed a surcharge for large Troig parties. Their extroversion made them natural entertainers - AndroosinLiann hosted the Eriadu talk show Essence, while another worked as a Coruscant circus fire-eater. The most famous Troig was Fodesinbeed Annodue ('Fode and Beed'), the premier Podracing announcer in the Outer Rim by 32 BBY. His bilingual commentary (Fode speaking Basic, Beed speaking Huttese) and coverage of events like Anakin Skywalker's Boonta Eve victory made him iconic. Not all offworld Troigs were entertainers - some served as pilots or diplomats, including one who sold droid G2-9T to Star Tours post-Endor.",

While most T'surr are marauding killers, some rare individuals join pirate crews or similar organizations, though they remain drawn to violent professions. No Force-sensitive T'surr have ever been recorded.",

Their society is divided by gender roles - males dominate spacefaring activities while females control domestic life. T'surr were never represented in the Galactic Senate due to their reputation as dangerous predators. Their technology lagged behind galactic standards, but they capably used scavenged equipment from victims. Wealth among T'surr is measured by slave ownership - a T'surr without slaves is considered as worthless as a freighter captain without a ship. Their most infamous representative was the pirate and slave trader Krayn.",

This unique hand structure gives them remarkable manual dexterity. They range in height from 1.5 to 2.0 meters tall. Their large eyes provide them with acute vision, complementing their manual abilities.",
    "species_personality": "Tsyklen are known for their precision and attention to detail, traits enhanced by their physical capabilities. They tend to be meticulous and patient, making them well-suited for tasks requiring fine motor skills and careful observation. Some individuals leverage these natural advantages for legitimate crafts, while others turn to more illicit activities like forgery when opportunity arises. Their personality often reflects their hand-eye coordination - calm, focused, and precise in their actions.",
    "species_background": "Native to the planet Tsyk, this species has evolved remarkable manual dexterity and visual acuity. While not widely known throughout the galaxy, some Tsyklen have made names for themselves in specialized fields that take advantage of their natural gifts. One notable female Tsyklen on Nar Hekka became a master forger, creating false identification for Han Solo and Chewbacca in 5 BBY. The species' attribute dice range shows their particular strengths in dexterity-related tasks, with average capability in other areas.",

Thanks to foresight, a planetary shield installed before the occupation prevented a full-scale Imperial assault. Eventually, the Yuuzhan Vong conquered and terraformed the world. Notable Tynnans include Odumin, a Corporate Sector Administrator, and Senator Streamdrinker, arrested for treason. Others like Cham and Nog Teleus brought Tynnan culture to the Cularin system.",

Both males and females stand between 1.4 to 1.9 meters tall, with males being slightly heavier in build. Their vocal cords can only produce rasping whispers, forcing them to rely on a sophisticated sign language called Ubeninal for communication among themselves.

While generally keeping to their own circles, they sometimes take work as mercenaries, bounty hunters, bodyguards, or slavers. They can be vengeful, particularly in matters involving Yrak Pootzck (a concept important to their culture).

They developed a highly refined sign language (Ubeninal) to compensate for their limited vocal capabilities. Organized in clans (such as Clan Culaz led by Vellux Trazel), they maintain a fiercely independent culture that shuns galactic politics. Their technological obsession stems from their survival needs on their harsh homeworld.

Their hands are dexterous with four digits, well-suited for mechanical work. Ugnaughts are known for their exceptional hardiness, able to withstand long periods of physical discomfort. They have an average lifespan of around 200 years, significantly longer than most humanoid species. Infant Ugnaughts are called Ugletts and mature slowly compared to other species.",

They follow a strict 'blood profession' system where each individual is raised to continue their family's trade. Despite their violent blood duel tradition to determine profession inheritance, they are generally peaceful people with a rich oral culture. Ugnaughts value hard work and craftsmanship, often becoming skilled technicians and engineers. They can be initially wary of outsiders but are fiercely loyal once trust is established. Their greeting customs are unique - they prefer a silent bow rather than verbal greetings, and consider the common intergalactic greeting 'yaa-yaah' to be a grave insult, often responding violently to its use.",
    "species_background": "Originally from the remote planet Gentes in the Anoat system, Ugnaughts were frequently taken from their homeworld as slaves long before the Imperial era, with entire tribes being sold into servitude. Those who remained on Gentes lived on the planet's inhospitable surface. Their society is organized around elected terend councils led by ufflor officers. On colonies like Cloud City, they were represented in the Parliament of Guilds. Ugnaughts maintain a strict caste system based on blood professions, with children being trained from birth in their family's trade. When too many Ugnaughts are born into a profession, they settle the excess through deadly blood duels at age 20. Despite this brutal tradition, they have thrived as mechanics and technicians throughout the galaxy, with some working in high-security facilities like the Oovo IV prison.",

They lacked permanent organs and instead used flexible organelles and pseudopodia, which could form limbs or tools like knives, umbrellas, or vises. Their nucleus-contained brains could control up to 30 pseudopodia simultaneously. In natural form, they moved slowly as blobs but could alter their shape to take on a crude humanoid form—stocky bodies with two thick, handless arms, two short legs, and eyestalks instead of a head. This humanoid form required concentration and was difficult to maintain. Many wore custom armored environment suits with dark helmets. Their appearance and odor were often found repulsive by other species, especially Squibs.",

Though naturally predatory and requiring substantial sustenance, they had evolved the ability to digest otherwise toxic waste.

Their brain’s capacity for multitasking made them cunning and efficient, especially in scavenging and trade.",
    "species_background": "Originally native to a lush planet in the Paradise system, the Ugors devastated their environment through overpopulation and industrial toxins. This led to their evolution into beings capable of consuming and thriving on garbage. They developed a religion centered around trash, worshipping it and organizing society around waste recovery. Their civilization transformed their planetary system into a massive junkyard, with waste companies reporting to the Holy Ugor Taxation Collection Agency.

The Overliege's responsibilities include improving planetary agricultural output and determining crop assignments for each community. This meritocratic system reflects the Ukians' pragmatic nature. Their farming expertise made Ukio a valuable world during the Clone Wars, when Grand Admiral Thrawn exploited their 'fear of the impossible' to capture the planet intact. Few Ukians leave their homeworld, but those who do almost always work in agriculture, spreading their species' renowned farming techniques across the galaxy.",

Their bodies contain a single heart, making it a vulnerable point that can prove fatal if injured.

While capable of speaking Basic, they primarily communicate in their native tongue among themselves. They are politically astute, as demonstrated by their shifting alliances during the Clone Wars. Some individuals possess strong persuasive abilities, with rumors of mind-influencing capabilities. Their advanced technology and strategic thinking make them formidable opponents, though they can appear aloof or mysterious to outsiders.

During the final decades of the Galactic Republic, they were represented by Senator Mee Deechi. Initially loyal to the Republic, they joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems after Deechi's assassination, bringing their advanced technology to the Separatists. Their homeworld became a battleground during the Clone Wars, where their sophisticated weaponry proved challenging for Republic forces. Notable Umbarans included Sly Moore, who served as an aide to Chancellor Palpatine. Their technology was later appropriated by the Galactic Empire. The species developed a unique written language with a 26-letter alphabet and maintained a society more technologically advanced than most in the galaxy, perfectly adapted to their shadowy homeworld.",

They are generally peaceful and cooperative, having lived harmoniously with the Pau'ans for generations.",

They developed techniques for taming the dangerous dactillions and useful varactyls that inhabited their world. When the Pau'ans arrived, the two species formed a mutually beneficial society, with the Utai naturally assuming the role of laborers and workers. They became particularly known as keepers of the varactyl mounts. Over time, a natural hierarchy developed with Pau'ans as rulers and Utai as the working class, though this arrangement was generally peaceful. The Utai continue to maintain the aquacultural fields in the lower depths of the sinkholes, using the water pools found there.

Vaathkree begin life as Stonesingers—small, shapeless nodes of living metal that roam the lava flats of their planet. Over time, they evolve into a stable, self-chosen form, often humanoid due to cultural influence.",

Their culture is built around 'The Deal,' a religious-philosophical code that governs all aspects of their lives. From a young age, Vaathkree are taught the principles of supply and demand, salesmanship, and the sacred art of haggling. This dedication makes them friendly but extremely shrewd merchants, who often cite their religion in commercial matters. They view fair trading as a sacred act and approach it with passion and seriousness.",

Vaathkree have been part of galactic society for millennia and are a familiar sight in trading hubs across the galaxy.

Forced into retreat, they spent years rebuilding and secretly allying with more powerful forces like the Yuuzhan Vong. The Vagaari later returned, contributing to the chaos of the galaxy post-Vong invasion and reclaiming power. A notable word in their language is 'Amacrisier,' meaning 'halt.'

Their most unusual anatomical feature is their multiple antestomachs, which they use both for food storage and to 'investigate' interesting objects by swallowing them. Their bodies are remarkably strong and tireless, making them exceptional physical laborers. Their skin is tough and leathery, well-suited to demanding work environments.",

They follow a strict theocratic caste system and show absolute obedience to their religious leaders, the bhodis. While generally reserved, they can become single-minded when pursuing tasks or religious observances. Their unusual eating habits - consuming large quantities infrequently and swallowing objects for examination - often make them social outcasts in multi-species environments. They are intensely curious about new objects and technologies, though their method of investigation (swallowing items) can be off-putting to other species. Despite being viewed as crude by some, they are intelligent and capable of sophisticated work when properly motivated by their religious leaders.",
    "species_background": "Native to Vasha, the Vashans live under the de facto rule of the Ayrou but maintain their own theocratic caste society. Their culture revolves around annual religious pilgrimages to Inicus Mont on the moon Qim, where during midwinter ceremonies their bhodis priests cough up symbolic gulletstones called sin-bullets. Though their homeworld is controlled by others, they have developed a reputation galaxy-wide as exceptional miners and laborers. Their society strictly adheres to caste roles determined by their religious hierarchy. The Vashans' unusual physiology and habits have led to discrimination in some sectors, particularly in food service establishments that ban them due to their messy eating habits. Despite this, their work ethic and physical capabilities make them valued workers in mining and industrial operations throughout the Modell sector and beyond.",

Their antennae contain tympanic nerves that allow them to detect sound wave vibrations and radio frequencies. Verpine evolved from hardy insects and are biologically adapted for life in the harsh environment of the Roche Asteroid Field.",
    "species_personality": "Verpine are naturally gifted in most fields of technology, possessing an almost child-like curiosity and deep respect for machines. Their culture centers around cooperation, precision, and engineering excellence, which they view not only as a necessity for survival but as a way of life. Their powerful nervous systems emit electromagnetic signals, allowing them to communicate across long distances through biologically generated radio waves—a trait mistaken by some as telepathy. This radio communication forms a constant network of contact across their colonies. They value efficiency, harmony, and innovation.",
    "species_background": "Verpine reside in the Roche Asteroid Field, a near-regular orbiting belt of rocky debris and ancient planetoids. Their origin is uncertain—some speculate they were nomads who chose to settle in the asteroids, while others believe their planet was destroyed by civil war, leaving only debris. Regardless, they have adapted expertly, hollowing asteroids into sealed, self-sufficient colonies. Each is equipped to provide all necessities: air, water, energy, and food. Cities in larger planetoids house thousands. Their starship building prowess is world-renowned, exemplified in the founding of the Slayn & Korpil Corporation—named for two neighboring colonies.",

Their eyes are so widely placed that they can see all around them, including behind them. They also have infrared vision, allowing them to see perfectly in the dark.

They rarely leave their homeworld, but if they do, they are pursued by elite warriors or bounty hunters.

Baby Vors are known to nest and curl up for protection, displaying body language somewhat interpretable by non-Vors.",
    "species_personality": "Vors are calm, composed, and spiritually oriented beings who value the collective over the individual. They suppress emotional outbursts in public, striving to maintain composure at all times. Despite seeming detached, they feel emotions as strongly as other sentients but reserve outward expression for music or private moments. This emotional restraint contributes to their prowess in negotiation and their subtle skills in games of chance.",
    "species_background": "The Vor species is renowned for their cultural contribution: the Cathedral of Winds, a monumental structure on Vortex that resonates with wind to produce music. The Vors fly through it during annual concerts, manipulating doors and windows to orchestrate harmonies, making the Cathedral one of the galaxy’s Twenty Wonders. Their music gained galactic fame, and although they ceased performances during the Galactic Empire’s rise, they resumed in 11 ABY. After the Empire's sabotage of a concert, the Vors built a new Cathedral and joined the New Republic, later supporting it during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion.",

The second, middle pair are strong legs that enable powerful leaping, while the final rear pair are vestigial, used only to prevent their abdomens from dragging. Vratix bodies are covered in small, thin hairs that shift color to reflect emotional states. They secrete denin, a chemical affecting skin color, closely tied to their clicking speech pattern called Vratix. Despite this, they can communicate in Basic for trade, and they are slightly telepathic, capable of sharing thoughts with closely related Vratix.",
    "species_personality": "Logical and straightforward, Vratix struggle with abstract thought such as art or music, but excel at problem-solving through meticulous analysis. Their society is hive-based, and they often refer to themselves using plural pronouns. They prefer personal interaction over remote communication and customarily greet others through physical touch—especially on the face, shoulders, or arms—because they consider touch the most trustworthy sense. Vratix are generally sociable and value hands-on interaction. They are also pragmatic, typically greeting and delivering information face-to-face.",
    "species_background": "The Vratix invented and shared bacta with the galaxy, eventually helping develop a galactic market for it. Despite the economic boom, they remained modest, working the kavam fields near their home villages and tolerating off-world exploitation of bacta. Over time, they felt their autonomy slipping and formed a resistance movement called the Ashern ('Black Claw') to take control of their fate. In 32 BBY, the Ashern helped lead a coup. Vratix culture includes the domestication of the Knytix—a smaller insectoid used both as a pet and in construction, thanks to its brick-making saliva. Offering one's Knytix to another Vratix is a sign of deep respect, and they are sometimes eaten during special occasions. Vratix are ruled by an elected leader called the Canir.",

They are excellent diplomats, leveraging their adaptability and strong sense of personal honor. Though their nomadic lifestyle often leads them to be misunderstood as primitive, they are deeply philosophical and highly intelligent. They prefer peaceful solutions but are also capable of fierce self-defense when required. Their nomadic instincts make them resilient in different environments, and they have a natural understanding of various cultures and traditions.",

They are primarily nomadic, traveling between the planet's many islands and rarely establishing permanent settlements. Vurks have a rich cultural tradition rooted in personal freedom, integrity, and philosophy. One of the most notable Vurks was Jedi Master Coleman Trebor, a member of the Jedi High Council, who fought valiantly during the Battle of Geonosis.

However, each Xi'Dec form was unique in its own temperament, shaped by its familial role. Their social structure revolved around diversity, with the most influential families containing the largest number of sexes. The Xi'Dec were uninterested in off-world politics unless it directly affected their family, and they frequently proposed marriage to outsiders, mistaking them for rare members of their species.",

Historically, Xi'Dec society focused on the prosperity of family units, and political leadership was often determined by the diversity and wealth of these units. The Xi'Dec lagged behind other galactic species in technological development, though they were experts in planetary and biological sciences. They were first contacted by Old Republic scouts, and later, some Xi'Dec became involved with the Galactic Rebellion, notably Diskio and K'lial Khzrry, who became Alliance Intelligence agents during the Galactic Civil War.",

Their skin ranges from chalk white to pale yellow, and their eyes are typically purple. Their brains are split: the skull governs primitive emotions and body functions, while the chest contains centers for logic and creativity. Though small in stature, their long necks and thin limbs allow for excellent mobility in vertical environments. The arms are specialized for climbing, and their agile physiology evolved in response to the challenges of arboreal life and natural predators like challat eaters.",
    "species_personality": "Despite being thrill-seekers and lovers of risk, Xexto are mild-mannered and even-tempered. Questioning a Xexto's bravery is one of the few ways to provoke them. They are known for being level-headed, polite, and calm under pressure. Their cultural admiration of risk-taking developed from the dangerous terrain and predators of Troiken. In social settings, Xexto prefer modesty—often concealing their second set of arms beneath clothing.",
    "species_background": "First discovered around 17,000 BBY by an Arkanian geneticist conducting illegal experiments, the Xexto were then a tribal species. Some were relocated to Quermia, leading to the creation of the Quermians, their larger, long-necked relatives. The Xexto continued to evolve independently and reached technological maturity in time to join the Galactic Republic. During the Stark Hyperspace War, most Xexto opposed both the Stark Combine and the Republic. They are known for their arboreal villages and long history of survival amid environmental threats.",

The main species tend to be quiet and focused, but under oppression they are bitter and quietly rebellious. Drones are loyal by design but some harbor hidden sympathies for the Republic. Free Yagai are rare and often paranoid about recapture. Many Yagai secretly wish to support the New Republic but fear reprisal against their kin. Their resistance to authority, particularly the Empire, simmers just beneath the surface.",
    "species_background": "Native to Yaga Minor, the Yagai were once renowned engineers who partnered with the Republic. Now enslaved by the Empire due to their knowledge of hyperdrive systems, many serve as conscripted workers in heavily fortified shipyards. Their planet is so well-defended that liberation seems impossible. The genetically modified Yagai Drones, bred for endurance and survival in hostile environments, are considered non-citizens by the Empire — a fact that has drawn the ire of the New Republic.

Their nostrils are almost imperceptible, while the mouth area consists of shuddering bump-like protrusions, sometimes exposing white teeth. Dual knobby crests and a spiky ridge adorn the back of the head. Yam'rii have long, narrow necks leading to broad shoulders, thin torsos, and knobby carapaces. Some feature clipper-like forelimbs used as weapons, while others have two-fingered hands. Their blood is green in color.",

They are carnivores with a strong preference for meat and eggs, reportedly even consuming the eggs of sentient beings or their own kind. Their expansionist tendencies and history of colonial exploitation suggest a calculating and opportunistic mindset. Despite their intimidating appearance and behavior, they are intelligent and capable of political manipulation, having orchestrated deceptive deals with the Galactic Republic for their advantage. They are known for tenacity and brutal retaliation when threatened.",
    "species_background": "Originating from the planet Huk, the Yam'rii used hyperspace technology to expand aggressively, exploiting nearby worlds for resources. They enslaved the native Kaleesh on Kalee, which led to a long, bloody war. Under Qymaen jai Sheelal—later known as General Grievous—the Kaleesh nearly wiped out the Yam'rii colonies. Despite their role as aggressors, the Yam'rii manipulated Republic politics to portray themselves as victims, avoiding punishment while the Kaleesh suffered severe sanctions. In later years, they joined the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances and during the Swarm War, some Yam'rii became Joiners aligned with the Killiks.",

They wear simple, rugged clothing suited for their desert-like environment, often adorned with remnants of Jedi and Sith artifacts, including masks, which they wear in battle. Their bodies are lean, honed by survival in the harsh conditions of their planet. Many Ysanna can be seen with tribal tattoos, symbolizing their connection to ancient Jedi beliefs.",
    "species_personality": "The Ysanna are fiercely independent, with a deep reverence for their ancient Jedi heritage, despite their knowledge of the Force being reduced to superstition. Their personalities are shaped by a sense of mysticism, deeply connected to the Force yet distant from its true understanding. They tend to be wary of outsiders, but once trust is earned, they can be fiercely loyal. Their culture emphasizes respect for their traditions and ancestors, and they are often seen as solitary and determined, relying on their own instincts and understanding of the world. The Ysanna are known to be somewhat secretive, especially regarding the protection of the Jedi ruins on Ossus.",
    "species_background": "The Ysanna are survivors of a devastating event—the Cron Supernova—that ravaged the planet Ossus. This event left the planet with a toxic, storm-ravaged atmosphere, and the Ysanna were forced to adapt quickly. Over time, they developed a nomadic existence, living as hunters and gatherers, relying on their primitive Force abilities to survive. Their connection to the Force, once potent and refined, was weakened by centuries of isolation, and the Ysanna came to practice what they called Ysanna magic, a simple, superstitious form of Force use. Despite their decline in Force abilities, they managed to preserve some ancient techniques, including the ability to form Force Ghosts. Their sacred duty is to protect the Jedi ruins scattered across their planet, guarding the secrets of the Jedi and their artifacts. Their society is highly spiritual, with a polytheistic religion centered around the Force and its mysteries.",

They possess sharp claws used for climbing and combat, as well as strong jaws capable of delivering powerful bites. Their thick fur protects them from harsh environments, while their keen sense of smell allows them to detect scents from considerable distances. Their massive size leads to long recovery times from intoxicants. Some scientists believe they may be distant relatives of Wookiees, possibly descended from Kashyyyk species enslaved by the Rakata. Their physical form combines brute strength with surprising agility for their size.",
    "species_personality": "Yuzzem are known for their fierce temperament and strict codes of honor. While volatile and quick to anger, they place great importance on fulfilling debts and obligations. They are physically intimidating but not needlessly aggressive - their strength is often matched by their sense of fairness. Yuzzem don't frighten easily and will stand their ground against threats. They can be stubborn and difficult to control when enslaved, as demonstrated by their resistance to Imperial forced labor programs. Despite their rough exterior, they form strong bonds with those who earn their trust and respect their honor codes. Their intelligence is often underestimated due to their brutish appearance, but they are capable of complex thought and problem-solving.",
    "species_background": "Native to Ragna III, the Yuzzem (not to be confused with Endor's Yuzzums) have a history intertwined with galactic conflicts. During the Separatist Crisis, they were employed as guards and soldiers by Separatist-aligned factions. The Galactic Empire later enslaved them like the Wookiees, though their rebellious nature made them poor slaves for mining operations. Notable Yuzzem include Hin and Kee who aided Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia on Mimban before being slain by Darth Vader, and Jedi Master Barratk'l who joined the Jedi High Council in 44 ABY. Their society values physical prowess and honor above all else, with strict traditions governing debt repayment and personal conduct. Their potential Force sensitivity was demonstrated by Barratk'l's ascension to Jedi Master status, though most Yuzzem follow more martial paths.",

Their physiology includes three unique biological traits: pheromone production similar to Falleen, emotional projection abilities, and natural empathy allowing them to read others' emotions. They have a secondary liver that grants exceptional alcohol tolerance. Zeltrons often appear strangely familiar to others even upon first meeting, and their facial features tend to be universally appealing across species. Their eyes typically have a slight luminescent quality that enhances their allure.",

They shun negative emotions like anger or sadness, both in themselves and others. Highly social and charismatic, they thrive on interaction and intimacy, viewing monogamy as quaintly impractical. While often stereotyped as lazy thrill-seekers, they can be surprisingly driven when pursuing pleasures or artistic expression. Their empathic abilities make them sensitive to others' emotional states, which they often try to 'correct' toward happiness. Despite their party-loving reputation, they can become formidable when provoked or when defending their lifestyle. They approach life with passion and creativity, especially in artistic and entertainment pursuits.",

Zeltros operates as a permanent 'party planet' where Zeltrons ensure all visitors enjoy themselves. Their famous Elixir of Infatuation is a sought-after aphrodisiac. While often dismissed as frivolous, their empathic abilities make them valuable to organizations like the Exchange. Zeltrons frequently wear flamboyant, revealing clothing in neon colors that match their vibrant personalities. Though differentiated enough from baseline Humans to be considered a separate species, they can interbreed with Humans and other near-Human species. Their culture maintains a delicate balance between boundless hedonism and genuine emotional connection.",

Due to their inability to see in the dark, Zelosians avoid going outdoors at night and hold numerous superstitions, particularly about the undead, which stemmed from parasitic worms reanimating corpses. Despite their blindness in the dark, they are well-versed in horticulture and excel at managing plant life under normal conditions.",

Their belief in the supernatural, particularly in regard to the undead, often governs their actions, and they remain wary of anything that threatens their peaceful existence. The Zelosians also share a strong affinity for natural cycles and have a deep respect for their environment, though this has often put them in opposition to external forces looking to exploit their planet’s resources.",

The Zelosians were unaware that the Empire's mining operations supported its war effort, believing instead that the Empire had abandoned their planet after the Battle of Endor. However, the Imperial presence continued secretly in the Valley of Umbra. After the Empire’s apparent withdrawal, Zelosian Galleros Nul declared martial law and seized power. Upon discovering the truth of the Empire’s continued presence, Nul shifted allegiances and sought to join the New Republic. This revelation led to a revolution of sorts, where Zelosians, once subjugated, now fight for their independence and sovereignty under a new banner.",

They were covered in gray scales with pointed heads that boasted long, curved tusks. Zexx were violent and possessive, often found acting as pirates or mercenaries for Hutt crimelords. Individuals of the race included Fnnbu.",

They hoard possessions, even if those items serve no purpose. Zexx were often found acting as pirates or mercenaries for Hutt crimelords.",

    "species_physical_description": "The Zizimaak are insectoid avians with long, sleek wings and a highly adaptable body structure that allows them to be powerful fliers. They have small, sharp beaks and large compound eyes that grant them excellent vision. Their coloration varies, with most individuals sporting a dark, metallic sheen to their exoskeleton, often in shades of black or deep purple. Their limbs are slender but strong, built for both flight and precision movement.",
    "species_personality": "Zizimaak are highly flighty and tend to prefer evasion over confrontation. They are intelligent and have a natural agility, but they often avoid direct conflict, focusing instead on finding safer, more strategic solutions. Though generally friendly, their preference for flight can make them seem aloof or disinterested, especially in stressful situations. They are known for their quick decision-making and adaptability in hostile environments.",
    "species_background": "The Zizimaak were created by the DarkStryder as a race of scouts, but they eventually escaped and built their own society. They despise their creator and, after forming alliances with species like the Charr Ontee and Yapi, they have made a name for themselves as fierce allies and adept survivors. The species has a complex history tied to both their genetic creation and their later rejection of their origins. Though they don't possess the mystical Ta-Ree life energy like other Kathol inhabitants, they are a strong and resourceful race.",
