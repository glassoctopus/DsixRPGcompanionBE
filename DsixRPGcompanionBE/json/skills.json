Likewise, some merchants will charge exorbitant fees, either as part of the 'bargaining process' or because of the local situation.\n\nThis skill is designed to be roleplayed rather than simply rolled. The gamemaster may also use a mixture of roleplaying and die rolls to determine how the character is doing. The player always has the choice to refuse a deal. If the gamemaster feels that the character's roll represents an unfair deal, without the player embellishing by roleplaying the situation, he should allow the gamemaster character to refuse the deal as well.\n\nTo resolve the haggling, make an opposed skill roll using any modifiers appropriate.

Bargain can also be used to bribe others. This skill use requires more than simply handing someone a stack of coins. The character must gain that person's confidence so they will believe the bribe will remain a secret. Bribery may also take the form of having to do favors: 'You know, if you allow me to 'buy back' my blaster (slipping the inspector a 100 credit coin), I can find out when Jabba's smugglers are going to be delivering the next shipment of Kessel spice. I'm sure that anyone who could bust that kind of shipment would receive a large reward ...'\n\nNote that there are few officials above accepting a bribe now and then — it's just a matter of figuring out how many credits or what favors will get the individual's attention. Characters make opposed bargain skill rolls when negotiating a bribe — if the recipient of the bribe rolls higher, he should be able to demand more money or favors for his cooperation.\n\nThe type and size of the bribe depends on the situation. Petty local officials may want 100 credits to get a confiscated blaster back or several thousand to get a ship out of the impound yard. A character may have to pay 15 or 20 credits to get a specific table at a restaurant, or possibly several hundred just to get a certain room at a posh hotel. If the official is famous or very powerful, bribes will have to be correspondingly large or somehow subtle (for example, giving an official's wife a loan at a very favorable interest rate). Remember that some characters have no use for bribes.\n\nThe size of the bribe also determines how well it is received. bribery_modifiers: +10 or more to target's roll: Bribe is insultingly small (less than half of what is reasonable). The bribing character may be reported to local officials.\n+5 to target's roll: Bribe is small (less than 90% of what is reasonable).\n+5 to bribing character's roll: Bribe is larger than expected.\n+10 or more to bribing character's roll: Bribe is much larger than is expected.\n     a_note_on_bribery: Imperial stormtroopers cannot be bribed.

When a character cheats, every other character is allowed to make an opposed gambling skill roll to see if they detect the cheat. The characters can make detection rolls every time the gambler attempts to cheat. If they fail, the gambler 'wins' the round. Modifiers include 'assistance' (more than one person looking for the cheater, or helping the cheater), one character's familiarity with the game being played surpasses the other's, or other factors.
